However, a significant limitation of\nsuch an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making\nits application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining\nconsistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences.\nThis paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON (Self-ALignMent with\nprinciple-fOllowiNg reward models), to align base language models with minimal\nhuman supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet\nachieving superior performance. Central to our approach is a\nprinciple-following reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this\nmodel can generate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles.\nBy merely adjusting these principles during the RL training phase, we gain full\ncontrol over the preferences with the reward model, subsequently influencing\nthe behavior of the RL-trained policies, and eliminating the reliance on the\ncollection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b\nbase language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2.

In particular, inputs phrased in an\nunderspecified way can result in incorrect answers due to factors like missing\nvisual information, complex implicit reasoning, or linguistic ambiguity.\nTherefore, adding visually grounded information to the input as a preemptive\nclarification should improve model performance by reducing underspecification,\ne.g., by localizing objects and disambiguating references. Similarly, in the\nVQA setting, changing the way questions are framed can make them easier for\nmodels to answer.

The solution\ntakes the form of feature-pair attributions, and can be reduced to a\ntoken-token matrix for STs. Our method involves the introduction of integrated\nJacobians and inherits the advantageous formal properties of integrated\ngradients: it accounts for the model's full computation graph and is guaranteed\nto converge to the actual prediction. A pilot study shows that in an ST few\ntoken-pairs can often explain large fractions of predictions, and it focuses on\nnouns and verbs. For accurate predictions, it however needs to attend to the\nmajority of tokens and parts of speech.\n","authors":["Lucas Möller","Dmitry Nikolaev","Sebastian Padó"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05703v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted to EMNLP'23"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17175v2","updated":"2023-10-09T13:23:53Z","published":"2023-06-17T23:35:51Z","title":"RECAP-KG: Mining Knowledge Graphs from Raw GP Notes for Remote COVID-19\n  Assessment in Primary Care","summary":"  Clinical decision-making is a fundamental stage in delivering appropriate\ncare to patients.

We think it well imitates human visual recognition, i.e.,\nhumans may use the ancestor class as a prompt to draw focus on the subtle\ndifferences among descendant classes. We model this prompting mechanism into a\nTransformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP). TransHP consists of three\nsteps: 1) learning a set of prompt tokens to represent the coarse (ancestor)\nclasses, 2) on-the-fly predicting the coarse class of the input image at an\nintermediate block, and 3) injecting the prompt token of the predicted coarse\nclass into the intermediate feature. Though the parameters of TransHP maintain\nthe same for all input images, the injected coarse-class prompt conditions\n(modifies) the subsequent feature extraction and encourages a dynamic focus on\nrelatively subtle differences among the descendant classes. Extensive\nexperiments show that TransHP improves image classification on accuracy (e.g.,\nimproving ViT-B/16 by +2.83% ImageNet classification accuracy), training data\nefficiency (e.g., +12.69% improvement under 10% ImageNet training data), and\nmodel explainability.

This is achieved by cascading ensemble members\nvia an early-exit approach. In this work, we investigate extending these\nefficiency gains to tasks related to uncertainty estimation.

The average annual rainfall for both countries is determined, and\nspatiotemporal variations in monthly average rainfall are examined at regional\nand reservoir basin levels using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed\nPrecipitation with Station (CHIRPS) dataset from 1981 to 2022. Water extents\nare derived for selected reservoirs using Sentinel-1 SAR Ground Range Detected\n(GRD) images in Vietnam and Sri Lanka from 2017 to 2022. The images are\npre-processed and corrected using terrain correction and refined Lee filter. An\nautomated thresholding algorithm, OTSU, distinguishes water and land, taking\nadvantage of both VV and VH polarization data. The connected pixel count\nthreshold is applied to enhance result accuracy. The results indicate a clear\nrelationship between rainfall patterns and reservoir water extent, with\nincreased precipitation during the monsoon season leading to higher water\nextents in the later months. This study contributes to understanding how\nrainfall variability impacts reservoir water resources in tropical monsoon\nregions. The preliminary findings can inform water resource management\nstrategies and support these countries' decision-making processes related to\nhydropower generation, flood management, and irrigation.\n","authors":["Punsisi Rajakaruna","Surajit Ghosh","Bunyod Holmatov"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05682v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05666v1","updated":"2023-10-09T12:35:05Z","published":"2023-10-09T12:35:05Z","title":"Anchor-Intermediate Detector: Decoupling and Coupling Bounding Boxes for\n  Accurate Object Detection","summary":"  Anchor-based detectors have been continuously developed for object detection.\nHowever, the individual anchor box makes it difficult to predict the boundary's\noffset accurately.

This\nwork proposes a solution to reduce the dependence on labelled 3D training data\nby leveraging pre-training on large-scale unlabeled outdoor LiDAR point clouds\nusing masked autoencoders (MAE). While existing masked point autoencoding\nmethods mainly focus on small-scale indoor point clouds or pillar-based\nlarge-scale outdoor LiDAR data, our approach introduces a new self-supervised\nmasked occupancy pre-training method called Occupancy-MAE, specifically\ndesigned for voxel-based large-scale outdoor LiDAR point clouds. Occupancy-MAE\ntakes advantage of the gradually sparse voxel occupancy structure of outdoor\nLiDAR point clouds and incorporates a range-aware random masking strategy and a\npretext task of occupancy prediction. By randomly masking voxels based on their\ndistance to the LiDAR and predicting the masked occupancy structure of the\nentire 3D surrounding scene, Occupancy-MAE encourages the extraction of\nhigh-level semantic information to reconstruct the masked voxel using only a\nsmall number of visible voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Occupancy-MAE across several downstream tasks. For 3D object\ndetection, Occupancy-MAE reduces the labelled data required for car detection\non the KITTI dataset by half and improves small object detection by\napproximately 2% in AP on the Waymo dataset. For 3D semantic segmentation,\nOccupancy-MAE outperforms training from scratch by around 2% in mIoU.

Various token\npruning techniques have been introduced to alleviate the high computational\nburden of ViTs by dynamically dropping image tokens. However, some undesirable\npruning at early stages may result in permanent loss of image information in\nsubsequent layers, consequently hindering model performance. To address this\nproblem, we propose IdleViT, a dynamic token-idle-based method that achieves an\nexcellent trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, in each\nlayer, IdleViT selects a subset of the image tokens to participate in\ncomputations while keeping the rest of the tokens idle and directly passing\nthem to this layer's output. By allowing the idle tokens to be re-selected in\nthe following layers, IdleViT mitigates the negative impact of improper pruning\nin the early stages. Furthermore, inspired by the normalized graph cut, we\ndevise a token cut loss on the attention map as regularization to improve\nIdleViT's token selection ability. Our method is simple yet effective and can\nbe extended to pyramid ViTs since no token is completely dropped.

Many existing works project the recovered voxel\nfingerprints onto the Bloch manifold to improve reconstruction performance.\nHowever, little research focuses on exploiting the latent manifold structure\npriors among fingerprints. To fill this gap, we propose a novel MRF\nreconstruction framework based on manifold structured data priors. Since it is\ndifficult to directly estimate the fingerprint manifold structure, we model the\ntissue parameters as points on a low-dimensional parameter manifold. We reveal\nthat the fingerprint manifold shares the same intrinsic topology as the\nparameter manifold, although being embedded in different Euclidean spaces. To\nexploit the non-linear and non-local redundancies in MRF data, we divide the\nMRF data into spatial patches, and the similarity measurement among data\npatches can be accurately obtained using the Euclidean distance between the\ncorresponding patches in the parameter manifold. The measured similarity is\nthen used to construct the graph Laplacian operator, which represents the\nfingerprint manifold structure. Thus, the fingerprint manifold structure is\nintroduced in the reconstruction framework by using the low-dimensional\nparameter manifold.

We utilized a vision transformer and initialized\nits weights based on (i) SSL pre-training on natural images (DINOv2), (ii) SL\npre-training on natural images (ImageNet dataset), and (iii) SL pre-training on\nchest radiographs from the MIMIC-CXR database. We tested our approach on over\n800,000 chest radiographs from six large global datasets, diagnosing more than\n20 different imaging findings. Our SSL pre-training on curated images not only\noutperformed ImageNet-based pre-training (P<0.001 for all datasets) but, in\ncertain cases, also exceeded SL on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our findings suggest\nthat selecting the right pre-training strategy, especially with SSL, can be\npivotal for improving artificial intelligence (AI)'s diagnostic accuracy in\nmedical imaging.

In this\npaper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics\nto human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5\ndatasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4\nexisting attack methods to reconstruct images from many different\nclassification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human\nannotators to assess whether this image is recognizable.

Existing deep learning-based fusion methods\ncan fully exploit the semantic features of each modality, they cannot\ndistinguish the effective low and high frequency information of each modality\nand fuse them adaptively. To address this issue, we propose AdaFuse, in which\nmultimodal image information is fused adaptively through frequency-guided\nattention mechanism based on Fourier transform. Specifically, we propose the\ncross-attention fusion (CAF) block, which adaptively fuses features of two\nmodalities in the spatial and frequency domains by exchanging key and query\nvalues, and then calculates the cross-attention scores between the spatial and\nfrequency features to further guide the spatial-frequential information fusion.\nThe CAF block enhances the high-frequency features of the different modalities\nso that the details in the fused images can be retained.

LightFC employs a noval\nefficient cross-correlation module (ECM) and a noval efficient rep-center head\n(ERH) to enhance the nonlinear expressiveness of the convoluational tracking\npipeline. The ECM adopts an architecture of attention-like module and fuses\nlocal spatial and channel features from the pixel-wise correlation fusion\nfeatures and enhance model nonlinearity with an inversion activation block.\nAdditionally, skip-connections and the reuse of search area features are\nintroduced by the ECM to improve its performance. The ERH reasonably introduces\nreparameterization technology and channel attention to enhance the nonlinear\nexpressiveness of the center head.

However, temporal\nasynchrony among agents is inevitable in the real world due to communication\ndelays, interruptions, and clock misalignments. This issue causes information\nmismatch during multi-agent fusion, seriously shaking the foundation of\ncollaboration. To address this issue, we propose CoBEVFlow, an\nasynchrony-robust collaborative perception system based on bird's eye view\n(BEV) flow. The key intuition of CoBEVFlow is to compensate motions to align\nasynchronous collaboration messages sent by multiple agents. To model the\nmotion in a scene, we propose BEV flow, which is a collection of the motion\nvector corresponding to each spatial location. Based on BEV flow, asynchronous\nperceptual features can be reassigned to appropriate positions, mitigating the\nimpact of asynchrony. CoBEVFlow has two advantages: (i) CoBEVFlow can handle\nasynchronous collaboration messages sent at irregular, continuous time stamps\nwithout discretization; and (ii) with BEV flow, CoBEVFlow only transports the\noriginal perceptual features, instead of generating new perceptual features,\navoiding additional noises. To validate CoBEVFlow's efficacy, we create\nIRregular V2V(IRV2V), the first synthetic collaborative perception dataset with\nvarious temporal asynchronies that simulate different real-world scenarios.\nExtensive experiments conducted on both IRV2V and the real-world dataset\nDAIR-V2X show that CoBEVFlow consistently outperforms other baselines and is\nrobust in extremely asynchronous settings.

In this paper, Discriminative Pseudo-label Sampling\n(DiPS) is introduced to leverage these class-agnostic maps for\nweakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), where only image-class labels are\navailable. Given multiple attention maps, DiPS relies on a pre-trained\nclassifier to identify the most discriminative regions of each attention map.\nThis ensures that the selected ROIs cover the correct image object while\ndiscarding the background ones, and, as such, provides a rich pool of diverse\nand discriminative proposals to cover different parts of the object.\nSubsequently, these proposals are used as pseudo-labels to train our new\ntransformer-based WSOL model designed to perform classification and\nlocalization tasks.

Additionally, we find that using gold answers for\noracle question candidate selection achieves a substantial gain in VQA accuracy\nby up to 14.41%. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that outputs from\nRepARe increase syntactic complexity, and effectively utilize vision-language\ninteraction and the frozen language model in LVLMs.\n","authors":["Archiki Prasad","Elias Stengel-Eskin","Mohit Bansal"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05861v1.pdf","comment":"22 pages, 4 figures, Code: https://github.com/archiki/RepARe"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08732v2","updated":"2023-10-09T16:55:39Z","published":"2023-05-15T15:47:09Z","title":"Knowledge Rumination for Pre-trained Language Models","summary":"  Previous studies have revealed that vanilla pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) lack the capacity to handle knowledge-intensive NLP tasks alone; thus,\nseveral works have attempted to integrate external knowledge into PLMs.\nHowever, despite the promising outcome, we empirically observe that PLMs may\nhave already encoded rich knowledge in their pre-trained parameters but fail to\nfully utilize them when applying them to knowledge-intensive tasks.

In response to this problem, we recently introduced an\noff-policy RL algorithm, called distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC or\nDSAC-v1), which can effectively improve the value estimation accuracy by\nlearning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Nonetheless, standard DSAC\nhas its own shortcomings, including occasionally unstable learning processes\nand needs for task-specific reward scaling, which may hinder its overall\nperformance and adaptability in some special tasks. This paper further\nintroduces three important refinements to standard DSAC in order to address\nthese shortcomings.

Without any task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T\nsurpasses a lot of mainstream model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3,\nDDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the BCF\nand show that it is worst-case optimal. We introduce the ControlTwicing\nalgorithm to estimate the BCF and analyze its predictive performance on\nsimulated and real world data.\n","authors":["Nicola Gnecco","Jonas Peters","Sebastian Engelke","Niklas Pfister"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05805v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01769v2","updated":"2023-10-09T15:43:26Z","published":"2023-10-03T03:34:22Z","title":"How Over-Parameterization Slows Down Gradient Descent in Matrix Sensing:\n  The Curses of Symmetry and Initialization","summary":"  This paper rigorously shows how over-parameterization changes the convergence\nbehaviors of gradient descent (GD) for the matrix sensing problem, where the\ngoal is to recover an unknown low-rank ground-truth matrix from near-isotropic\nlinear measurements. First, we consider the symmetric setting with the\nsymmetric parameterization where $M^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a\npositive semi-definite unknown matrix of rank $r \\ll n$, and one uses a\nsymmetric parameterization $XX^\\top$ to learn $M^*$. Here $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times k}$ with $k > r$ is the factor matrix. We give a novel $\\Omega (1/T^2)$\nlower bound of randomly initialized GD for the over-parameterized case ($k >r$)\nwhere $T$ is the number of iterations. This is in stark contrast to the\nexact-parameterization scenario ($k=r$) where the convergence rate is $\\exp\n(-\\Omega (T))$. Next, we study asymmetric setting where $M^* \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \\times n_2}$ is the unknown matrix of rank $r \\ll\n\\min\\{n_1,n_2\\}$, and one uses an asymmetric parameterization $FG^\\top$ to\nlearn $M^*$ where $F \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \\times k}$ and $G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_2\n\\times k}$.

Although Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) presents a promising\nsolution, its accurate implementation within the context of LLMs remains a\nsignificant hurdle. To address this critical roadblock, our research originates\nfrom a fundamental heuristic insight: tokens within auto-regressive\nLLM-generated text do not equally reflect the underlying meaning.

At the same time, many types of machine learning models do not lend\nthemselves to parameter aggregation, such as decision trees, or rule ensembles.\nIt has been observed that in many applications, in particular healthcare, large\nunlabeled datasets are publicly available. They can be used to exchange\ninformation between clients by distributed distillation, i.e., co-regularizing\nlocal training via the discrepancy between the soft predictions of each local\nclient on the unlabeled dataset. This, however, still discloses private\ninformation and restricts the types of models to those trainable via\ngradient-based methods. We propose to go one step further and use a form of\nfederated co-training, where local hard labels on the public unlabeled datasets\nare shared and aggregated into a consensus label. This consensus label can be\nused for local training by any supervised machine learning model. We show that\nthis federated co-training approach achieves a model quality comparable to both\nfederated learning and distributed distillation on a set of benchmark datasets\nand real-world medical datasets. It improves privacy over both approaches,\nprotecting against common membership inference attacks to the highest degree.\nFurthermore, we show that federated co-training can collaboratively train\ninterpretable models, such as decision trees and rule ensembles, achieving a\nmodel quality comparable to centralized training.\n","authors":["Amr Abourayya","Jens Kleesiek","Kanishka Rao","Erman Ayday","Bharat Rao","Geoff Webb","Michael Kamp"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05696v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05695v1","updated":"2023-10-09T13:15:57Z","published":"2023-10-09T13:15:57Z","title":"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Pattern Prediction","summary":"  In this work, we explore the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)\nfor the task of temporal sequence prediction.

We address this problem using Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) by proposing a dynamic relation-attentive aggregation mechanism. Based\non the observation that many real-world graphs include different types of\nrelations, we propose to learn a node representation per relation and aggregate\nthe node representations using a learnable attention function that assigns a\ndifferent attention coefficient to each relation. Furthermore, we combine the\nnode representations from different layers to consider both the local and\nglobal structures of a target node, which is beneficial to improving the\nperformance of fraud detection on graphs with heterophily.

Moreover, two views of two different images are considered\nas a negative pair, and their similarity is encouraged to be low. Normally, a\nsingle similarity measure given by a single projection head is used to evaluate\npositive and negative sample pairs, respectively. However, due to the various\naugmentation strategies and varying intra-sample similarity, augmented views\nfrom the same image are often not similar. Moreover, due to inter-sample\nsimilarity, augmented views of two different images may be more similar than\naugmented views from the same image. As such, enforcing a high similarity for\npositive pairs and a low similarity for negative pairs may not always be\nachievable, and in the case of some pairs, forcing so may be detrimental to the\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose to use multiple projection\nheads, each producing a separate set of features.

Even if fairness properties are related to the features\nof the used prediction model, what is more properly called 'fair' or 'unfair'\nis a decision system, not a prediction model. This is because fairness is about\nthe consequences on human lives, created by a decision, not by a prediction. We\nclarify the distinction between the concepts of prediction and decision and\nshow the different ways in which these two elements influence the final\nfairness properties of a prediction-based decision system. In addition to\nexploring this relationship conceptually and practically, we propose a\nframework that enables a better understanding and reasoning of the conceptual\nlogic of creating fairness in prediction-based decision-making.

One of\nthe most notable issues is the Janus problem, where the most canonical view of\nan object (\\textit{e.g}., face or head) appears in other views. In this work,\nwe explore existing frameworks for score-distilling text-to-3D generation and\nidentify the main causes of the view inconsistency problem -- the embedded bias\nof 2D diffusion models. Based on these findings, we propose two approaches to\ndebias the score-distillation frameworks for view-consistent text-to-3D\ngeneration. Our first approach, called score debiasing, involves cutting off\nthe score estimated by 2D diffusion models and gradually increasing the\ntruncation value throughout the optimization process. Our second approach,\ncalled prompt debiasing, identifies conflicting words between user prompts and\nview prompts using a language model, and adjusts the discrepancy between view\nprompts and the viewing direction of an object.

System heterogeneity, including heterogeneous computing and\nnetwork bandwidth, has been addressed to mitigate the impact of stragglers.\nPrevious studies tackle the system heterogeneity by splitting a model into\nsubmodels, but with less degree-of-freedom in terms of model architecture.

The existing multi-camera algorithms primarily rely on\nmonocular 2D pre-training. However, the monocular 2D pre-training overlooks the\nspatial and temporal correlations among the multi-camera system. To address\nthis limitation, we propose the first multi-camera unified pre-training\nframework, called UniScene, which involves initially reconstructing the 3D\nscene as the foundational stage and subsequently fine-tuning the model on\ndownstream tasks. Specifically, we employ Occupancy as the general\nrepresentation for the 3D scene, enabling the model to grasp geometric priors\nof the surrounding world through pre-training. A significant benefit of\nUniScene is its capability to utilize a considerable volume of unlabeled\nimage-LiDAR pairs for pre-training purposes. The proposed multi-camera unified\npre-training framework demonstrates promising results in key tasks such as\nmulti-camera 3D object detection and surrounding semantic scene completion.\nWhen compared to monocular pre-training methods on the nuScenes dataset,\nUniScene shows a significant improvement of about 2.0% in mAP and 2.0% in NDS\nfor multi-camera 3D object detection, as well as a 3% increase in mIoU for\nsurrounding semantic scene completion. By adopting our unified pre-training\nmethod, a 25% reduction in 3D training annotation costs can be achieved,\noffering significant practical value for the implementation of real-world\nautonomous driving.

However, these methods still suffer from two\nlimitations: first, as they fuse the features of text and image before\nmatching, they cannot fully exploit the fine-grained alignment relations\nbetween the mention and entity. Second, their alignment is static, leading to\nlow performance when dealing with complex and diverse data. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Relation Interactive\nNetwork (DRIN) for MEL tasks.

Current trajectory\nprediction models depend on long, complete, and accurately observed sequences\nfrom visual modalities. Nevertheless, real-world situations often involve\nobstructed cameras, missed objects, or objects out of sight due to\nenvironmental factors, leading to incomplete or noisy trajectories. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose LTrajDiff, a novel approach that treats objects\nobstructed or out of sight as equally important as those with fully visible\ntrajectories. LTrajDiff utilizes sensor data from mobile phones to surmount\nout-of-sight constraints, albeit introducing new challenges such as modality\nfusion, noisy data, and the absence of spatial layout and object size\ninformation. We employ a denoising diffusion model to predict precise layout\nsequences from noisy mobile data using a coarse-to-fine diffusion strategy,\nincorporating the RMS, Siamese Masked Encoding Module, and MFM. Our model\npredicts layout sequences by implicitly inferring object size and projection\nstatus from a single reference timestamp or significantly obstructed sequences.\nAchieving SOTA results in randomly obstructed experiments and extremely short\ninput experiments, our model illustrates the effectiveness of leveraging noisy\nmobile data. In summary, our approach offers a promising solution to the\nchallenges faced by layout sequence and trajectory prediction models in\nreal-world settings, paving the way for utilizing sensor data from mobile\nphones to accurately predict pedestrian bounding box trajectories.

Furthermore, we condense multilingual\nknowledge from multiple LS modules into a single shared module with the Fuse\nDistillation (FD) technique to improve the efficiency of inference and model\nserialization. We show that our LMS method significantly outperforms previous\nLS methods and MoE methods with the same amount of extra parameters, e.g., 1.73\nBLEU points over the Switch Transformer on many-to-many multilingual machine\ntranslation. Importantly, LMS is able to have comparable translation\nperformance with much fewer parameters.\n","authors":["Haoran Xu","Weiting Tan","Shuyue Stella Li","Yunmo Chen","Benjamin Van Durme","Philipp Koehn","Kenton Murray"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13993v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at the main conference of EMNLP 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02105v2","updated":"2023-10-08T18:07:56Z","published":"2023-06-03T13:11:37Z","title":"Adapting Pretrained ASR Models to Low-resource Clinical Speech using\n  Epistemic Uncertainty-based Data Selection","summary":"  While there has been significant progress in ASR, African-accented clinical\nASR has been understudied due to a lack of training datasets.

The resulting model, which we call RelBERT, captures relational\nsimilarity in a surprisingly fine-grained way, allowing us to set a new\nstate-of-the-art in analogy benchmarks. Crucially, RelBERT is capable of\nmodelling relations that go well beyond what the model has seen during\ntraining. For instance, we obtained strong results on relations between named\nentities with a model that was only trained on lexical relations between\nconcepts, and we observed that RelBERT can recognise morphological analogies\ndespite not being trained on such examples.

In light of this, we\nintroduce MazzumaGPT, a large language model that has been optimised to\ngenerate smart contract code and aid developers to scaffold development and\nimprove productivity. As part of this research, we outline the optimisation and\nfine-tuning parameters, evaluate the model's performance on functional\ncorrectness and address the limitations and broader impacts of our research.\n","authors":["Nii Osae Osae Dade","Margaret Lartey-Quaye","Emmanuel Teye-Kofi Odonkor","Paul Ammah"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05178v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05177v1","updated":"2023-10-08T14:26:55Z","published":"2023-10-08T14:26:55Z","title":"Do Large Language Models Know about Facts?","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) have recently driven striking performance\nimprovements across a range of natural language processing tasks. The factual\nknowledge acquired during pretraining and instruction tuning can be useful in\nvarious downstream tasks, such as question answering, and language generation.\nUnlike conventional Knowledge Bases (KBs) that explicitly store factual\nknowledge, LLMs implicitly store facts in their parameters. Content generated\nby the LLMs can often exhibit inaccuracies or deviations from the truth, due to\nfacts that can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. To this\nend, we aim to comprehensively evaluate the extent and scope of factual\nknowledge within LLMs by designing the benchmark Pinocchio. Pinocchio contains\n20K diverse factual questions that span different sources, timelines, domains,\nregions, and languages. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs are able to\ncompose multiple facts, update factual knowledge temporally, reason over\nmultiple pieces of facts, identify subtle factual differences, and resist\nadversarial examples. Extensive experiments on different sizes and types of\nLLMs show that existing LLMs still lack factual knowledge and suffer from\nvarious spurious correlations.

In this work, we uncover a distinct and prevalent\nphenomenon within diffusion models in contrast to most other generative models,\nwhich we refer to as ``consistent model reproducibility''. To elaborate, our\nextensive experiments have consistently shown that when starting with the same\ninitial noise input and sampling with a deterministic solver, diffusion models\ntend to produce nearly identical output content. This consistency holds true\nregardless of the choices of model architectures and training procedures.\nAdditionally, our research has unveiled that this exceptional model\nreproducibility manifests in two distinct training regimes: (i) ``memorization\nregime,'' characterized by a significantly overparameterized model which\nattains reproducibility mainly by memorizing the training data; (ii)\n``generalization regime,'' in which the model is trained on an extensive\ndataset, and its reproducibility emerges with the model's generalization\ncapabilities. Our analysis provides theoretical justification for the model\nreproducibility in ``memorization regime''. Moreover, our research reveals that\nthis valuable property generalizes to many variants of diffusion models,\nincluding conditional diffusion models, diffusion models for solving inverse\nproblems, and fine-tuned diffusion models. A deeper understanding of this\nphenomenon has the potential to yield more interpretable and controllable data\ngenerative processes based on diffusion models.\n","authors":["Huijie Zhang","Jinfan Zhou","Yifu Lu","Minzhe Guo","Liyue Shen","Qing Qu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05264v1.pdf","comment":"41 pages, 21 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05262v1","updated":"2023-10-08T18:51:33Z","published":"2023-10-08T18:51:33Z","title":"Structure-Preserving Instance Segmentation via Skeleton-Aware Distance\n  Transform","summary":"  Objects with complex structures pose significant challenges to existing\ninstance segmentation methods that rely on boundary or affinity maps, which are\nvulnerable to small errors around contacting pixels that cause noticeable\nconnectivity change.

To\ncounter packet losses without retransmission, two primary strategies are\nemployed -- encoder-based forward error correction (FEC) and decoder-based\nerror concealment. The former encodes data with redundancy before transmission,\nyet determining the optimal redundancy level in advance proves challenging. The\nlatter reconstructs video from partially received frames, but dividing a frame\ninto independently coded partitions inherently compromises compression\nefficiency, and the lost information cannot be effectively recovered by the\ndecoder without adapting the encoder.\n  We present a loss-resilient real-time video system called GRACE, which\npreserves the user's quality of experience (QoE) across a wide range of packet\nlosses through a new neural video codec. Central to GRACE's enhanced loss\nresilience is its joint training of the neural encoder and decoder under a\nspectrum of simulated packet losses. In lossless scenarios, GRACE achieves\nvideo quality on par with conventional codecs (e.g., H.265). As the loss rate\nescalates, GRACE exhibits a more graceful, less pronounced decline in quality,\nconsistently outperforming other loss-resilient schemes. Through extensive\nevaluation on various videos and real network traces, we demonstrate that GRACE\nreduces undecodable frames by 95% and stall duration by 90% compared with FEC,\nwhile markedly boosting video quality over error concealment methods.

However, research has shown that this assumption does not\nalways hold, and decoding strategies which directly optimize a utility\nfunction, like Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) or Quality-Aware decoding can\nsignificantly improve translation quality over standard MAP decoding. The main\ndisadvantage of these methods is that they require an additional model to\npredict the utility, and additional steps during decoding, which makes the\nentire process computationally demanding.

We call such an optimal prompt the magic word since\nprepending the prompt causes the LLM to output the correct answer. If magic\nwords exist, can we find them? If so, what are their properties?

Previous efforts for\nadapting LLMs to a longer length usually requires fine-tuning with this target\nlength (Full-length fine-tuning), suffering intensive training cost. To\ndecouple train length from target length for efficient context window\nextension, we propose Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) training that smartly\nsimulates long inputs using a fixed context window. This is achieved by first\ndividing the original context window into several chunks, then designing\ndistinct skipping bias terms to manipulate the position indices of each chunk.\nThese bias terms and the lengths of each chunk are altered for every training\nexample, allowing the model to adapt to all positions within target length.\nExperimental results show that PoSE greatly reduces memory and time overhead\ncompared with Full-length fine-tuning, with minimal impact on performance.\nLeveraging this advantage, we have successfully extended the LLaMA model to\n128k tokens using a 2k training context window. Furthermore, we empirically\nconfirm that PoSE is compatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and position\ninterpolation strategies.

Thus, optimizing this accuracy-efficiency trade-off is\ncrucial for the LLM deployment on commodity hardware. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new perspective to optimize this trade-off by prompting compressed\nmodels. Specifically, we first observe that for certain questions, the\ngeneration quality of a compressed LLM can be significantly improved by adding\ncarefully designed hard prompts, though this isn't the case for all questions.\nBased on this observation, we propose a soft prompt learning method where we\nexpose the compressed model to the prompt learning process, aiming to enhance\nthe performance of prompts.

We\nevaluated the transfer learning ability of the prompt-based learning algorithms\nin a cross-institution setting. We also assessed the few-shot learning ability.\nResults and Conclusion When LLMs are unfrozen, GatorTron-3.9B with soft\nprompting achieves the best strict F1-scores of 0.9118 and 0.8604 for concept\nextraction, outperforming the traditional fine-tuning and hard prompt-based\nmodels by 0.6~3.1% and 1.2~2.9%, respectively; GatorTron-345M with soft\nprompting achieves the best F1-scores of 0.8332 and 0.7488 for end-to-end\nrelation extraction, outperforming the other two models by 0.2~2% and\n0.6~11.7%, respectively. When LLMs are frozen, small (i.e., 345 million\nparameters) LLMs have a big gap to be competitive with unfrozen models; scaling\nLLMs up to billions of parameters makes frozen LLMs competitive with unfrozen\nLLMs. For cross-institute evaluation, soft prompting with a frozen\nGatorTron-8.9B model achieved the best performance. This study demonstrates\nthat (1) machines can learn soft prompts better than humans, (2) frozen LLMs\nhave better few-shot learning ability and transfer learning ability to\nfacilitate muti-institution applications, and (3) frozen LLMs require large\nmodels.\n","authors":["Cheng Peng","Xi Yang","Kaleb E Smith","Zehao Yu","Aokun Chen","Jiang Bian","Yonghui Wu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06239v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00297v2","updated":"2023-10-10T01:22:47Z","published":"2023-09-30T08:13:49Z","title":"Understanding In-Context Learning from Repetitions","summary":"  This paper explores the elusive mechanism underpinning in-context learning in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs).

Recent works of Basu\net al. (2023) and Kaba et al.

We hypothesize that this is because pretrained models\nprovide better quality features for certain transformations than others and\nsimply averaging them is deleterious. Hence, we propose {\\lambda}-equitune that\naverages the features using importance weights, {\\lambda}s. These weights are\nlearned directly from the data using a small neural network, leading to\nexcellent zero-shot and finetuned results that outperform equitune. Further, we\nprove that {\\lambda}-equitune is equivariant and a universal approximator of\nequivariant functions.

However, voluntary\nbreath-holding and often arrhythmia, in combination with MRI's slow imaging\nspeed, can lead to motion artifacts, hindering real-time acquisition image\nquality. Although performing accelerated acquisitions can facilitate dynamic\nimaging, it induces aliasing, causing low reconstructed image quality in Cine\nMRI and inaccurate T1 and T2 mapping estimation. In this work, inspired by\nrelated work in accelerated MRI reconstruction, we present a deep learning\n(DL)-based method for accelerated cine and multi-contrast reconstruction in the\ncontext of dynamic cardiac imaging. We formulate the reconstruction problem as\na least squares regularized optimization task, and employ vSHARP, a\nstate-of-the-art DL-based inverse problem solver, which incorporates\nhalf-quadratic variable splitting and the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers with neural networks. We treat the problem in two setups; a 2D\nreconstruction and a 2D dynamic reconstruction task, and employ 2D and 3D deep\nlearning networks, respectively. Our method optimizes in both the image and\nk-space domains, allowing for high reconstruction fidelity. Although the target\ndata is undersampled with a Cartesian equispaced scheme, we train our model\nusing both Cartesian and simulated non-Cartesian undersampling schemes to\nenhance generalization of the model to unseen data. Furthermore, our model\nadopts a deep neural network to learn and refine the sensitivity maps of\nmulti-coil k-space data. Lastly, our method is jointly trained on both,\nundersampled cine and multi-contrast data.\n","authors":["George Yiasemis","Nikita Moriakov","Jan-Jakob Sonke","Jonas Teuwen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06628v1.pdf","comment":"12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

Compared with single-vehicle perception, multi-view\nvehicle-road cooperation perception has fundamental advantages, such as the\nelimination of blind spots and a broader range of perception, and has become a\nresearch hotspot. However, the current perception of cooperation focuses on\nimproving the complexity of fusion while ignoring the fundamental problems\ncaused by the absence of single-view outlines. We propose a multi-view\nvehicle-road cooperation perception system, vehicle-to-everything cooperative\nperception (V2X-AHD), in order to enhance the identification capability,\nparticularly for predicting the vehicle's shape.

The key to IML\nlies in revealing the artifacts or inconsistencies between the tampered and\nauthentic areas, which are evident under pixel-level features. Consequently,\nexisting studies treat IML as a low-level vision task, focusing on allocating\ntampered masks by crafting pixel-level features such as image RGB noises, edge\nsignals, or high-frequency features. However, in practice, tampering commonly\noccurs at the object level, and different classes of objects have varying\nlikelihoods of becoming targets of tampering. Therefore, object semantics are\nalso vital in identifying the tampered areas in addition to pixel-level\nfeatures. This necessitates IML models to carry out a semantic understanding of\nthe entire image. In this paper, we reformulate the IML task as a high-level\nvision task that greatly benefits from low-level features. Based on such an\ninterpretation, we propose a method to enhance the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) by\nincorporating high-resolution inputs and a perceptual loss supervision module,\nwhich is termed Perceptual MAE (PMAE). While MAE has demonstrated an impressive\nunderstanding of object semantics, PMAE can also compensate for low-level\nsemantics with our proposed enhancements. Evidenced by extensive experiments,\nthis paradigm effectively unites the low-level and high-level features of the\nIML task and outperforms state-of-the-art tampering localization methods on all\nfive publicly available datasets.\n","authors":["Xiaochen Ma","Jizhe Zhou","Xiong Xu","Zhuohang Jiang","Chi-Man Pun"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06525v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04494v3","updated":"2023-10-10T11:10:59Z","published":"2023-01-11T14:42:47Z","title":"Multi-label Image Classification using Adaptive Graph Convolutional\n  Networks: from a Single Domain to Multiple Domains","summary":"  This paper proposes an adaptive graph-based approach for multi-label image\nclassification.

In order to obtain better generation and segmentation performance, a\ncoordination-spatial attention generation adversarial network (CASP-GAN) based\non the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is proposed.\nThe performance of the generator is optimized by introducing the Coordinate\nAttention (CA) module and the Spatial Attention (SA) module.

To guide the imagination towards creating informative samples\nfor model training, we introduce two key criteria, i.e., class-maintained\ninformation boosting and sample diversity promotion.

However, most state-of-the-art methods use the freeze strategy\nfor stability, which compromises the model's plasticity.In contrast, releasing\nparameter training for plasticity could lead to the best performance for all\ncategories, but this requires discriminative feature representation.Therefore,\nwe prioritize the model's plasticity and propose the Contrast inter- and\nintra-class representations for Incremental Segmentation (CoinSeg), which\npursues discriminative representations for flexible parameter tuning. Inspired\nby the Gaussian mixture model that samples from a mixture of Gaussian\ndistributions, CoinSeg emphasizes intra-class diversity with multiple\ncontrastive representation centroids. Specifically, we use mask proposals to\nidentify regions with strong objectness that are likely to be diverse\ninstances/centroids of a category. These mask proposals are then used for\ncontrastive representations to reinforce intra-class diversity.

In this\npaper, we propose a new structured pruning method. Firstly, to create more\nstructured redundancy, we present a data-driven loss function term calculated\nfrom the correlation coefficient matrix of different feature maps in the same\nlayer, named CCM-loss. This loss term can encourage the neural network to learn\nstronger linear representation relations between feature maps during the\ntraining from the scratch so that more homogenous parts can be removed later in\npruning. CCM-loss provides us with another universal transcendental\nmathematical tool besides L*-norm regularization, which concentrates on\ngenerating zeros, to generate more redundancy but for the different genres.\nFurthermore, we design a matching channel selection strategy based on principal\ncomponents analysis to exploit the maximum potential ability of CCM-loss. In\nour new strategy, we mainly focus on the consistency and integrality of the\ninformation flow in the network.

However, this stability-plasticity trade-off\nremains a central challenge. This paper introduces a framework that dissects\nthis trade-off, offering valuable insights into CL algorithms. The\nReadout-Decomposition of Activation Change (RDAC) framework first addresses the\nstability-plasticity dilemma and its relation to catastrophic forgetting. It\nrelates learning-induced activation changes in the range of prior readouts to\nthe degree of stability and changes in the null space to the degree of\nplasticity. In deep non-linear networks tackling split-CIFAR-110 tasks, the\nframework clarifies the stability-plasticity trade-offs of the popular\nregularization algorithms Synaptic intelligence (SI), Elastic-weight\nconsolidation (EWC), and learning without Forgetting (LwF), and replay-based\nalgorithms Gradient episodic memory (GEM), and data replay. GEM and data replay\npreserved stability and plasticity, while SI, EWC, and LwF traded off\nplasticity for stability. The inability of the regularization algorithms to\nmaintain plasticity was linked to them restricting the change of activations in\nthe null space of the prior readout. Additionally, for one-hidden-layer linear\nneural networks, we derived a gradient decomposition algorithm to restrict\nactivation change only in the range of the prior readouts, to maintain high\nstability while not further sacrificing plasticity.

However, owing to the inconsistency in pose\nbetween the source and target images, synthesizing an image with a distinct\npose, relying exclusively on the source image and target pose information,\nremains a formidable challenge. This paper presents Progressive Conditional\nDiffusion Models (PCDMs) that incrementally bridge the gap between person\nimages under the target and source poses through three stages. Specifically, in\nthe first stage, we design a simple prior conditional diffusion model that\npredicts the global features of the target image by mining the global alignment\nrelationship between pose coordinates and image appearance. Then, the second\nstage establishes a dense correspondence between the source and target images\nusing the global features from the previous stage, and an inpainting\nconditional diffusion model is proposed to further align and enhance the\ncontextual features, generating a coarse-grained person image.

Recent works of Basu\net al. (2023) and Kaba et al.

We hypothesize that this is because pretrained models\nprovide better quality features for certain transformations than others and\nsimply averaging them is deleterious. Hence, we propose {\\lambda}-equitune that\naverages the features using importance weights, {\\lambda}s. These weights are\nlearned directly from the data using a small neural network, leading to\nexcellent zero-shot and finetuned results that outperform equitune. Further, we\nprove that {\\lambda}-equitune is equivariant and a universal approximator of\nequivariant functions.

To achieve LLM-based recommendation, item indexing and\ngeneration grounding are two essential steps, bridging between recommendation\nitems and natural language. Item indexing assigns a unique identifier to\nrepresent each item in natural language, and generation grounding grounds the\ngenerated token sequences to in-corpus items. However, previous works suffer\nfrom inherent limitations in the two steps. For item indexing, existing\nID-based identifiers (e.g., numeric IDs) and description-based identifiers\n(e.g., titles) often compromise semantic richness or uniqueness. Moreover,\ngeneration grounding might inadvertently produce out-of-corpus identifiers.\nWorse still, autoregressive generation heavily relies on the initial token's\nquality. To combat these issues, we propose a novel multi-facet paradigm,\nnamely TransRec, to bridge the LLMs to recommendation. Specifically, TransRec\nemploys multi-facet identifiers that incorporate ID, title, and attribute,\nachieving both distinctiveness and semantics.

To address this, we propose a novel task, Scientific DOcument\nRetrieval using Multi-level Aspect-based quEries (DORIS-MAE), which is designed\nto handle the complex nature of user queries in scientific research. We\ndeveloped a benchmark dataset within the field of computer science, consisting\nof 100 human-authored complex query cases.

Recognizing the significant labor of expert annotation, we\nalso introduce Anno-GPT, a scalable framework for validating the performance of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) on expert-level dataset annotation tasks. LLM\nannotation of the DORIS-MAE dataset resulted in a 500x reduction in cost,\nwithout compromising quality. Furthermore, due to the multi-tiered structure of\nthese complex queries, the DORIS-MAE dataset can be extended to over 4,000\nsub-query test cases without requiring additional annotation.

This unique platform not only offers interactive user engagement but\nalso suggests music tailored for input videos, so that users can refine and\npersonalize their music selections. In contrast, previous systems predominantly\nemphasized content compatibility, often overlooking the nuances of users'\nindividual preferences. For example, all the datasets only provide basic\nmusic-video pairings or such pairings with textual music descriptions. To\naddress this gap, our research offers three contributions. First, we devise a\nconversation-synthesis method that simulates a two-turn interaction between a\nuser and a recommendation system, which leverages pre-trained music tags and\nartist information. In this interaction, users submit a video to the system,\nwhich then suggests a suitable music piece with a rationale. Afterwards, users\ncommunicate their musical preferences, and the system presents a refined music\nrecommendation with reasoning. Second, we introduce a multi-modal\nrecommendation engine that matches music either by aligning it with visual cues\nfrom the video or by harmonizing visual information, feedback from previously\nrecommended music, and the user's textual input. Third, we bridge music\nrepresentations and textual data with a Large Language Model(Vicuna-7B). This\nalignment equips MuseChat to deliver music recommendations and their underlying\nreasoning in a manner resembling human communication.

However, these works typically follow an\nideal setup, i.e., different domains obey similar data distribution, which\nignores the bias brought by asymmetric interaction densities (a.k.a. the\ninter-domain density bias). Besides, the frequently adopted mechanism (e.g.,\nthe self-attention network) in sequence encoder only focuses on the\ninteractions within a local view, which overlooks the global correlations\nbetween different training batches. To this end, we propose an External\nAttention-enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning framework, namely EA-GCL.\nSpecifically, to remove the impact of the inter-domain density bias, an\nauxiliary Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) task is attached to the traditional\ngraph encoder under a multi-task learning manner.

However, despite the\nimportance of these activities, they are quite challenging, where days can be\nspent on the manual triaging process.

To address this gap, we propose to use longitudinal\nmulti-modal data, i.e., previous patient visit CXR, current visit CXR, and\nprevious visit report, to pre-fill the 'findings' section of a current patient\nvisit report. We first gathered the longitudinal visit information for 26,625\npatients from the MIMIC-CXR dataset and created a new dataset called\nLongitudinal-MIMIC.

The measurement and structural models can be\nestimated jointly using the so-called one-step approach or sequentially using\nstepwise methods, which present significant advantages for practitioners\nregarding the interpretability of the estimated latent classes. In addition to\nthe one-step approach, StepMix implements the most important stepwise\nestimation methods from the literature, including the bias-adjusted three-step\nmethods with Bolk-Croon-Hagenaars and maximum likelihood corrections and the\nmore recent two-step approach. These pseudo-likelihood estimators are presented\nin this paper under a unified framework as specific expectation-maximization\nsubroutines. To facilitate and promote their adoption among the data science\ncommunity, StepMix follows the object-oriented design of the scikit-learn\nlibrary and provides an additional R wrapper.\n","authors":["Sacha Morin","Robin Legault","Félix Laliberté","Zsuzsa Bakk","Charles-Édouard Giguère","Roxane de la Sablonnière","Éric Lacourse"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03853v4.pdf","comment":"Sacha Morin and Robin Legault contributed equally"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06746v1","updated":"2023-10-10T16:19:20Z","published":"2023-10-10T16:19:20Z","title":"Causal Rule Learning: Enhancing the Understanding of Heterogeneous\n  Treatment Effect via Weighted Causal Rules","summary":"  Interpretability is a key concern in estimating heterogeneous treatment\neffects using machine learning methods, especially for healthcare applications\nwhere high-stake decisions are often made. Inspired by the Predictive,\nDescriptive, Relevant framework of interpretability, we propose causal rule\nlearning which finds a refined set of causal rules characterizing potential\nsubgroups to estimate and enhance our understanding of heterogeneous treatment\neffects. Causal rule learning involves three phases: rule discovery, rule\nselection, and rule analysis. In the rule discovery phase, we utilize a causal\nforest to generate a pool of causal rules with corresponding subgroup average\ntreatment effects. The selection phase then employs a D-learning method to\nselect a subset of these rules to deconstruct individual-level treatment\neffects as a linear combination of the subgroup-level effects. This helps to\nanswer an ignored question by previous literature: what if an individual\nsimultaneously belongs to multiple groups with different average treatment\neffects? The rule analysis phase outlines a detailed procedure to further\nanalyze each rule in the subset from multiple perspectives, revealing the most\npromising rules for further validation. The rules themselves, their\ncorresponding subgroup treatment effects, and their weights in the linear\ncombination give us more insights into heterogeneous treatment effects.\nSimulation and real-world data analysis demonstrate the superior performance of\ncausal rule learning on the interpretable estimation of heterogeneous treatment\neffect when the ground truth is complex and the sample size is sufficient.\n","authors":["Ying Wu","Hanzhong Liu","Kai Ren","Xiangyu Chang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06746v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06743v1","updated":"2023-10-10T16:12:17Z","published":"2023-10-10T16:12:17Z","title":"Geographic Location Encoding with Spherical Harmonics and Sinusoidal\n  Representation Networks","summary":"  Learning feature representations of geographical space is vital for any\nmachine learning model that integrates geolocated data, spanning application\ndomains such as remote sensing, ecology, or epidemiology.

This notion is referred to as faithfulness, an essential\nproperty that reflects the alignment between the identified (attributed)\nfeatures and the features used by the model. One recent trend to test\nfaithfulness is to design the data such that we know which input features are\nrelevant to the label and then train a model on the designed data.\nSubsequently, the identified features are evaluated by comparing them with\nthese designed ground truth features.

Extended from\npurely data-driven approaches, existing physics-informed approaches such as\nHamiltonian Neural Network strictly follow energy conservation law to introduce\ninductive bias, making their learning more sample efficiently. However, many\nreal-world systems do not strictly conserve energy, such as spring systems with\nfrictions. Recognizing this, we turn our attention to a broader physical\nprinciple: Time-Reversal Symmetry, which depicts that the dynamics of a system\nshall remain invariant when traversed back over time. It still helps to\npreserve energies for conservative systems and in the meanwhile, serves as a\nstrong inductive bias for non-conservative, reversible systems. To inject such\ninductive bias, in this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective\nself-supervised regularization term as a soft constraint that aligns the\nforward and backward trajectories predicted by a continuous graph neural\nnetwork-based ordinary differential equation (GraphODE). It effectively imposes\ntime-reversal symmetry to enable more accurate model predictions across a wider\nrange of dynamical systems under classical mechanics. In addition, we further\nprovide theoretical analysis to show that our regularization essentially\nminimizes higher-order Taylor expansion terms during the ODE integration steps,\nwhich enables our model to be more noise-tolerant and even applicable to\nirreversible systems.

Recognising that phase-encode artefacts can be\nseparated into contiguous 1D signals, we develop two decoupling techniques that\nenable explicit 1D regularisation and leverage the excellent 1D incoherence\ncharacteristics. We also derive a combined 1D + 2D reconstruction technique\nthat takes advantage of spatial relationships within the image. Experiments\nconducted on retrospectively under-sampled brain and knee data demonstrate that\ncombination of the proposed 1D AliasNet modules with existing 2D deep learned\n(DL) recovery techniques leads to an improvement in image quality. We also find\nAliasNet enables a superior scaling of performance compared to increasing the\nsize of the original 2D network layers. AliasNet therefore improves the\nregularisation of aliasing artefacts arising from phase-encode under-sampling,\nby tailoring the network architecture to account for their expected appearance.\nThe proposed 1D + 2D approach is compatible with any existing 2D DL recovery\ntechnique deployed for this application.\n","authors":["Marlon E.

The problem is, however,\nchallenging due to complex and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations between\nlocations, uneven distribution of urban events in space, and the difficulty to\ncorrectly rank nearby locations with similar features. Prior works on event\nforecasting mostly aim at accurately predicting the actual risk score or counts\nof events for all the locations.

Learning-to-rank methods directly optimize\nmeasures such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), but cannot\nhandle the spatiotemporal autocorrelation existing among locations.

The diverse inference\nconstraints in these scenarios necessitate practitioners to train foundation\nmodels such as PaLM 2, Llama, & ViTs as a series of models of varying sizes.\nDue to significant training costs, only a select few model sizes are trained\nand supported, limiting more fine-grained control over relevant tradeoffs,\nincluding latency, cost, and accuracy. This work introduces MatFormer, a nested\nTransformer architecture designed to offer elasticity in a variety of\ndeployment constraints. Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a MatFormer\nmodel is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This training\nprocedure allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers --\ni.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of\naccurate smaller models, which were never explicitly optimized. We empirically\ndemonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness across different model classes (decoders\n& encoders), modalities (language & vision), and scales (up to 2.6B\nparameters).

Various\nmachine-learning-based approaches have been developed for this purpose, but\nthey often require a large corpus of dataset-visualization pairs for training\nand lack natural explanations for their results. To address this research gap,\nwe propose LLM4Vis, a novel ChatGPT-based prompting approach to perform\nvisualization recommendation and return human-like explanations using very few\ndemonstration examples. Our approach involves feature description,\ndemonstration example selection, explanation generation, demonstration example\nconstruction, and inference steps.

In particular, pretraining\nmethods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their\npotential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing\npretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT\npretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically\ntailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of\nexploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the\nfine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping\nand non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance\nimprovement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a\nvery low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less\ndistinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping\ntokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of\npre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that\nthese layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization\ncan benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate\npretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we\nintroduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the\ntask difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask\nboundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge. RandomMask is simple but\neffective, achieving top-tier performance across 26 datasets of 28 datasets\nspanning 7 downstream tasks.\n","authors":["Chaoqi Liang","Weiqiang Bai","Lifeng Qiao","Yuchen Ren","Jianle Sun","Peng Ye","Hongliang Yan","Xinzhu Ma","Wangmeng Zuo","Wanli Ouyang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07644v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07641v1","updated":"2023-10-11T16:38:11Z","published":"2023-10-11T16:38:11Z","title":"Evaluating Large Language Models at Evaluating Instruction Following","summary":"  As research in large language models (LLMs) continues to accelerate,\nLLM-based evaluation has emerged as a scalable and cost-effective alternative\nto human evaluations for comparing the ever increasing list of models.

In\nthis paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation\nBounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent\ncharacteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models.\nImportantly, we prove that within the limits of this framework, for any\nbehavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there\nexist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with\nprobability that increases with the length of the prompt. This implies that any\nalignment process that attenuates an undesired behavior but does not remove it\naltogether, is not safe against adversarial prompting attacks. Furthermore, our\nframework hints at the mechanism by which leading alignment approaches such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback make the LLM prone to being prompted\ninto the undesired behaviors.

Given that LLM inference is memory-bounded, the surplus\ncomputational power in a typical LLM serving cluster can be repurposed for\nonline retraining of draft models, thereby making the training cost-neutral.\nSince the query distribution of an LLM service is relatively simple, retraining\non query distribution enables the draft model to more accurately predict the\ntarget model's outputs, particularly on data originating from query\ndistributions. As the draft model evolves online, it aligns with the query\ndistribution in real time, mitigating distribution shifts.

Moreover, a model can be\ntrained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset\ncan be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks\nto select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of\nmodels trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two\ndominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing data\ndiversity in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign difficulty scores to\nsamples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a\ncoreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty\nranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning\nmodels. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two\ncomplementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset\nselection. We represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel\npruning algorithm, D2 Pruning, that uses forward and reverse message passing\nover this dataset graph for coreset selection. D2 Pruning updates the\ndifficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its\nneighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty\nscores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that\nencapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We\nevaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various\nvision and language datasets.

In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling\n(SatLM) approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use an\nLLM to generate a declarative task specification rather than an imperative\nprogram and leverage an off-the-shelf automated theorem prover to derive the\nfinal answer. This approach has two key advantages. The declarative\nspecification is closer to the problem description than the reasoning steps\nare, so the LLM can parse it out of the description more accurately.\nFurthermore, by offloading the actual reasoning task to an automated theorem\nprover, our approach can guarantee the correctness of the answer with respect\nto the parsed specification and avoid planning errors in the solving process.\nWe evaluate SATLM on 8 different datasets and show that it consistently\noutperforms program-aided LMs in the imperative paradigm. In particular, SATLM\noutperforms program-aided LMs by 23% on a challenging subset of the GSM\narithmetic reasoning dataset; SATLM also achieves a new SoTA on LSAT and\nBoardgameQA, surpassing previous models that are trained on the respective\ntraining sets.\n","authors":["Xi Ye","Qiaochu Chen","Isil Dillig","Greg Durrett"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09656v3.pdf","comment":"NeurIPS 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07889v1","updated":"2023-10-11T20:52:30Z","published":"2023-10-11T20:52:30Z","title":"LangNav: Language as a Perceptual Representation for Navigation","summary":"  We explore the use of language as a perceptual representation for\nvision-and-language navigation.

The diverse inference\nconstraints in these scenarios necessitate practitioners to train foundation\nmodels such as PaLM 2, Llama, & ViTs as a series of models of varying sizes.\nDue to significant training costs, only a select few model sizes are trained\nand supported, limiting more fine-grained control over relevant tradeoffs,\nincluding latency, cost, and accuracy. This work introduces MatFormer, a nested\nTransformer architecture designed to offer elasticity in a variety of\ndeployment constraints. Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a MatFormer\nmodel is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This training\nprocedure allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers --\ni.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of\naccurate smaller models, which were never explicitly optimized. We empirically\ndemonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness across different model classes (decoders\n& encoders), modalities (language & vision), and scales (up to 2.6B\nparameters). We find that a 2.6B decoder-only MatFormer language model (MatLM)\nallows us to extract smaller models spanning from 1.5B to 2.6B, each exhibiting\ncomparable validation loss and one-shot downstream evaluations to their\nindependently trained counterparts. Furthermore, we observe that smaller\nencoders extracted from a universal MatFormer-based ViT (MatViT) encoder\npreserve the metric-space structure for adaptive large-scale retrieval.\nFinally, we showcase that speculative decoding with the accurate and consistent\nsubmodels extracted from MatFormer can further reduce inference latency.\n","authors":[" Devvrit","Sneha Kudugunta","Aditya Kusupati","Tim Dettmers","Kaifeng Chen","Inderjit Dhillon","Yulia Tsvetkov","Hannaneh Hajishirzi","Sham Kakade","Ali Farhadi","Prateek Jain"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07707v1.pdf","comment":"31 pages, 12 figures, first three authors contributed equally"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07704v1","updated":"2023-10-11T17:55:15Z","published":"2023-10-11T17:55:15Z","title":"Ferret: Refer and Ground Anything Anywhere at Any Granularity","summary":"  We introduce Ferret, a new Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of\nunderstanding spatial referring of any shape or granularity within an image and\naccurately grounding open-vocabulary descriptions.

As a new perspective, we examine the structural components of the U-Net\nin diffusion models and identify the crucial cause as the limited perception\nfield of convolutional kernels. Based on this key observation, we propose a\nsimple yet effective re-dilation that can dynamically adjust the convolutional\nperception field during inference.

Existing methods for rewriting captions using large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown promise on small, curated datasets like CC3M\nand CC12M. Nevertheless, their efficacy on massive web-captured captions is\nconstrained by the inherent noise and randomness in such data. In this study,\nwe address this limitation by focusing on two key aspects: data quality and\ndata variety.

Understanding these flares\ncan provide a window into black hole accretion processes. Although\nsophisticated simulations predict the formation of these flares, their\nstructure has yet to be recovered by observations. Here we show the first\nthree-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an emission flare in orbit recovered\nfrom ALMA light curves observed on April 11, 2017. Our recovery results show\ncompact bright regions at a distance of roughly 6 times the event horizon.\nMoreover, our recovery suggests a clockwise rotation in a low-inclination\norbital plane, a result consistent with prior studies by EHT and GRAVITY\ncollaborations. To recover this emission structure we solve a highly ill-posed\ntomography problem by integrating a neural 3D representation (an emergent\nartificial intelligence approach for 3D reconstruction) with a gravitational\nmodel for black holes.

Visual prompt learning (VPL) has thus emerged to\nprovide an efficient and flexible alternative to model fine-tuning through\nVisual Prompt as a Service (VPPTaaS). Specifically, the VPPTaaS provider\noptimizes a visual prompt given downstream data, and downstream users can use\nthis prompt together with the large pre-trained model for prediction. However,\nthis new learning paradigm may also pose security risks when the VPPTaaS\nprovider instead provides a malicious visual prompt. In this paper, we take the\nfirst step to explore such risks through the lens of backdoor attacks.\nSpecifically, we propose BadVisualPrompt, a simple yet effective backdoor\nattack against VPL. For example, poisoning $5\\%$ CIFAR10 training data leads to\nabove $99\\%$ attack success rates with only negligible model accuracy drop by\n$1.5\\%$. In particular, we identify and then address a new technical challenge\nrelated to interactions between the backdoor trigger and visual prompt, which\ndoes not exist in conventional, model-level backdoors. Moreover, we provide\nin-depth analyses of seven backdoor defenses from model, prompt, and input\nlevels.

Additionally, we find that the assumption of normal distribution of the\ncore position of plain fingerprint recordings cannot be rejected, but for\nrolled ones it can. Therefore, we use a multi-step process to find the\ndistribution of the rolled fingerprint recordings. The process consists of an\nAnderson-Darling normality test, the Bayesian Information Criterion to reduce\nthe number of possible candidate distributions and finally a Generalized Monte\nCarlo goodness-of-fit procedure to find the best fitting distribution.

To this end, we propose a novel pre-training\nframework by adopting both self-supervised and supervised visual pre-text tasks\nin a multi-task manner.

To better align DC with\nthis hierarchical nature and encourage more efficient information sharing\ninside data containers, we propose a novel data parameterization architecture,\nHierarchical Memory Network (HMN).

To resolve this challenge, previous approaches have\nresorted to different features in the generation process aimed at representing\nappearance and motion. However, in the absence of strict mechanisms to\nguarantee such disentanglement, a separation of motion from appearance has\nremained challenging, resulting in spatial distortions and temporal jittering\nthat break the spatio-temporal coherency. Motivated by this, we here propose\nLEO, a novel framework for human video synthesis, placing emphasis on\nspatio-temporal coherency. Our key idea is to represent motion as a sequence of\nflow maps in the generation process, which inherently isolate motion from\nappearance. We implement this idea via a flow-based image animator and a Latent\nMotion Diffusion Model (LMDM). The former bridges a space of motion codes with\nthe space of flow maps, and synthesizes video frames in a warp-and-inpaint\nmanner. LMDM learns to capture motion prior in the training data by\nsynthesizing sequences of motion codes.

The key\nunderpinnings to achieve this are a 3D radiance field generator and a volume\nrendering process. However, existing methods either cannot generate\nhigh-resolution images (e.g., up to 256X256) due to the high computation cost\nof neural volume rendering, or rely on 2D CNNs for image-space upsampling which\njeopardizes the 3D consistency across different views. This paper proposes a\nnovel 3D-aware GAN that can generate high resolution images (up to 1024X1024)\nwhile keeping strict 3D consistency as in volume rendering. Our motivation is\nto achieve super-resolution directly in the 3D space to preserve 3D\nconsistency. We avoid the otherwise prohibitively-expensive computation cost by\napplying 2D convolutions on a set of 2D radiance manifolds defined in the\nrecent generative radiance manifold (GRAM) approach, and apply dedicated loss\nfunctions for effective GAN training at high resolution. Experiments on FFHQ\nand AFHQv2 datasets show that our method can produce high-quality 3D-consistent\nresults that significantly outperform existing methods.

An\nabstract action semantic (i.e., walk forwards) could be conveyed by\nperceptually diverse motions (walk with arms up or swinging), while a motion\ncould carry different semantics w.r.t. its context and intention. This makes an\nelegant mapping between them difficult. Previous attempts adopted\ndirect-mapping paradigms with limited reliability. Also, current automatic\nmetrics fail to provide reliable assessments of the consistency between motions\nand action semantics. We identify the source of these problems as the\nsignificant gap between the two modalities. To alleviate this gap, we propose\nKinematic Phrases (KP) that take the objective kinematic facts of human motion\nwith proper abstraction, interpretability, and generality characteristics.\nBased on KP as a mediator, we can unify a motion knowledge base and build a\nmotion understanding system. Meanwhile, KP can be automatically converted from\nmotions and to text descriptions with no subjective bias, inspiring Kinematic\nPrompt Generation (KPG) as a novel automatic motion generation benchmark.

Existing solutions often rely on learning-free\nmethods or pretrained models to laboriously generate pseudo masks, triggering\nDice constraint subsequently. In this paper, we found that a model guided by\nthe simplest box-filled masks can accurately predict polyp locations/sizes, but\nsuffers from shape collapsing. In response, we propose two innovative learning\nfashions, Improved Box-dice (IBox) and Contrastive Latent-Anchors (CLA), and\ncombine them to train a robust box-supervised model IBoxCLA. The core idea\nbehind IBoxCLA is to decouple the learning of location/size and shape, allowing\nfor focused constraints on each of them. Specifically, IBox transforms the\nsegmentation map into a proxy map using shape decoupling and confusion-region\nswapping sequentially. Within the proxy map, shapes are disentangled, while\nlocations/sizes are encoded as box-like responses. By constraining the proxy\nmap instead of the raw prediction, the box-filled mask can well supervise\nIBoxCLA without misleading its shape learning. Furthermore, CLA contributes to\nshape learning by generating two types of latent anchors, which are learned and\nupdated using momentum and segmented polyps to steadily represent polyp and\nbackground features. The latent anchors facilitate IBoxCLA to capture\ndiscriminative features within and outside boxes in a contrastive manner,\nyielding clearer boundaries. We benchmark IBoxCLA on five public polyp\ndatasets.

First, the classic batch norm updating strategy,\ncommonly used in classification TTA, only brings slight performance\nimprovement, and in some cases it might even adversely affect the results.

Model\ndistillation, the process of creating smaller, faster models that maintain the\nperformance of larger models, is a promising direction towards the solution.\nThis paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large\nteacher vision-language models into lightweight student models using a small-\nor mid-scale dataset. Notably, this study focuses on open-vocabulary\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a challenging problem that has been\noverlooked in previous model distillation literature. We propose two principles\nfrom vision and language modality perspectives to enhance student's OOD\ngeneralization: (1) by better imitating teacher's visual representation space,\nand carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the\nteacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with\ninformative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish\nbetween different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive\nexperiments to investigate their techniques.

Towards Visual Representation Alignment for Robot\n  Learning","summary":"  When operating in service of people, robots need to optimize rewards aligned\nwith end-user preferences. Since robots will rely on raw perceptual inputs like\nRGB images, their rewards will inevitably use visual representations. Recently\nthere has been excitement in using representations from pre-trained visual\nmodels, but key to making these work in robotics is fine-tuning, which is\ntypically done via proxy tasks like dynamics prediction or enforcing temporal\ncycle-consistency. However, all these proxy tasks bypass the human's input on\nwhat matters to them, exacerbating spurious correlations and ultimately leading\nto robot behaviors that are misaligned with user preferences. In this work, we\npropose that robots should leverage human feedback to align their visual\nrepresentations with the end-user and disentangle what matters for the task. We\npropose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), a method for\nsolving the visual representation alignment problem and visual reward learning\nproblem through the lens of preference-based learning and optimal transport.\nAcross experiments in X-MAGICAL and in robotic manipulation, we find that\nRAPL's reward consistently generates preferred robot behaviors with high sample\nefficiency, and shows strong zero-shot generalization when the visual\nrepresentation is learned from a different embodiment than the robot's.\n","authors":["Ran Tian","Chenfeng Xu","Masayoshi Tomizuka","Jitendra Malik","Andrea Bajcsy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07932v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07931v1","updated":"2023-10-11T23:01:29Z","published":"2023-10-11T23:01:29Z","title":"D2 Pruning: Message Passing for Balancing Diversity and Difficulty in\n  Data Pruning","summary":"  Analytical theories suggest that higher-quality data can lead to lower test\nerrors in models trained on a fixed data budget. Moreover, a model can be\ntrained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset\ncan be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks\nto select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of\nmodels trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two\ndominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing data\ndiversity in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign difficulty scores to\nsamples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a\ncoreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty\nranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning\nmodels. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two\ncomplementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset\nselection. We represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel\npruning algorithm, D2 Pruning, that uses forward and reverse message passing\nover this dataset graph for coreset selection. D2 Pruning updates the\ndifficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its\nneighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty\nscores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that\nencapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We\nevaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various\nvision and language datasets. Results show that D2 Pruning improves coreset\nselection over previous state-of-the-art methods for up to 70% pruning rates.\nAdditionally, we find that using D2 Pruning for filtering large multimodal\ndatasets leads to increased diversity in the dataset and improved\ngeneralization of pretrained models.\n","authors":["Adyasha Maharana","Prateek Yadav","Mohit Bansal"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07931v1.pdf","comment":"17 pages (Our code is available at\n  https://github.com/adymaharana/d2pruning)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12364v2","updated":"2023-10-11T22:38:38Z","published":"2023-08-23T18:08:32Z","title":"Saliency-based Video Summarization for Face Anti-spoofing","summary":"  With the growing availability of databases for face presentation attack\ndetection, researchers are increasingly focusing on video-based face\nanti-spoofing methods that involve hundreds to thousands of images for training\nthe models.

These\nchallenges cannot be addressed by LLMs alone, but should rely on assistance\nfrom the external world, such as knowledge base, memory store, demonstration\nexamples, and tools. Retrieval augmentation stands as a vital mechanism for\nbridging the gap between LLMs and the external assistance. However,\nconventional methods encounter two pressing issues. On one hand, the\ngeneral-purpose retrievers are not properly optimized for the retrieval\naugmentation of LLMs. On the other hand, the task-specific retrievers lack the\nrequired versatility, hindering their performance across the diverse retrieval\naugmentation scenarios.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach, the LLM Embedder, which\ncomprehensively support the diverse needs of LLMs' retrieval augmentation with\none unified embedding model. Training such an unified model is non-trivial, as\nvarious retrieval tasks aim to capture distinct semantic relationships, often\nsubject to mutual interference. To address this challenge, we systematically\noptimize our training methodology. This includes reward formulation based on\nLLMs' feedback, the stabilization of knowledge distillation, multi-task\nfine-tuning with explicit instructions, and the use of homogeneous in-batch\nnegative sampling. These optimization strategies contribute to the outstanding\nempirical performance of the LLM-Embedder.

In this work, we introduce\nRetro 48B, the largest LLM pretrained with retrieval before instruction tuning.\nSpecifically, we continue to pretrain the 43B GPT model on additional 100\nbillion tokens using the Retro augmentation method by retrieving from 1.2\ntrillion tokens. The obtained foundation model, Retro 48B, largely outperforms\nthe original 43B GPT in terms of perplexity. After instruction tuning on Retro,\nInstructRetro demonstrates significant improvement over the instruction tuned\nGPT on zero-shot question answering (QA) tasks.

To address this, we propose\npermutation self-consistency, a form of self-consistency over ranking list\noutputs of black-box LLMs. Our key idea is to marginalize out different list\norders in the prompt to produce an order-independent ranking with less\npositional bias. First, given some input prompt, we repeatedly shuffle the list\nin the prompt and pass it through the LLM while holding the instructions the\nsame. Next, we aggregate the resulting sample of rankings by computing the\ncentral ranking closest in distance to all of them, marginalizing out prompt\norder biases in the process.

In particular, pretraining\nmethods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their\npotential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing\npretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT\npretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically\ntailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of\nexploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the\nfine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping\nand non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance\nimprovement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a\nvery low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less\ndistinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping\ntokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of\npre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that\nthese layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization\ncan benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate\npretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we\nintroduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the\ntask difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask\nboundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge.

Another key\nprinciple is the right to an actionable explanation, also known as algorithmic\nrecourse, allowing users to reverse unfavorable decisions. To date, it is\nunknown whether these two principles can be operationalized simultaneously.\nTherefore, we introduce and study the problem of recourse invalidation in the\ncontext of data deletion requests. More specifically, we theoretically and\nempirically analyze the behavior of popular state-of-the-art algorithms and\ndemonstrate that the recourses generated by these algorithms are likely to be\ninvalidated if a small number of data deletion requests (e.g., 1 or 2) warrant\nupdates of the predictive model. For the setting of differentiable models, we\nsuggest a framework to identify a minimal subset of critical training points\nwhich, when removed, maximize the fraction of invalidated recourses. Using our\nframework, we empirically show that the removal of as little as 2 data\ninstances from the training set can invalidate up to 95 percent of all\nrecourses output by popular state-of-the-art algorithms.

We exhibit explicit constructions of data\nre-uploading PQCs for approximating continuous and smooth functions and\nestablish quantitative approximation error bounds in terms of the width, the\ndepth and the number of trainable parameters of the PQCs.

However, not independent and identically\ndistributed (non-IID) distribution among edge clients can impair the local\nmodel performance. The existing single prototype-based strategy represents a\nclass by using the mean of the feature space. However, feature spaces are\nusually not clustered, and a single prototype may not represent a class well.\nMotivated by this, this paper proposes a multi-prototype federated contrastive\nlearning approach (MP-FedCL) which demonstrates the effectiveness of using a\nmulti-prototype strategy over a single-prototype under non-IID settings,\nincluding both label and feature skewness. Specifically, a multi-prototype\ncomputation strategy based on \\textit{k-means} is first proposed to capture\ndifferent embedding representations for each class space, using multiple\nprototypes ($k$ centroids) to represent a class in the embedding space. In each\nglobal round, the computed multiple prototypes and their respective model\nparameters are sent to the edge server for aggregation into a global prototype\npool, which is then sent back to all clients to guide their local training.\nFinally, local training for each client minimizes their own supervised learning\ntasks and learns from shared prototypes in the global prototype pool through\nsupervised contrastive learning, which encourages them to learn knowledge\nrelated to their own class from others and reduces the absorption of unrelated\nknowledge in each global iteration. Experimental results on MNIST, Digit-5,\nOffice-10, and DomainNet show that our method outperforms multiple baselines,\nwith an average test accuracy improvement of about 4.6\\% and 10.4\\% under\nfeature and label non-IID distributions, respectively.\n","authors":["Yu Qiao","Md.

The intuition behind data parameterization is to\nencode shared features of images to avoid additional storage costs. In this\npaper, we recognize that images share common features in a hierarchical way due\nto the inherent hierarchical structure of the classification system, which is\noverlooked by current data parameterization methods. To better align DC with\nthis hierarchical nature and encourage more efficient information sharing\ninside data containers, we propose a novel data parameterization architecture,\nHierarchical Memory Network (HMN).

Another helpful property of the hierarchical architecture is that HMN\nnaturally ensures good independence among images despite achieving information\nsharing. This enables instance-level pruning for HMN to reduce redundant\ninformation, thereby further minimizing redundancy and enhancing performance.\nWe evaluate HMN on four public datasets (SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and\nTiny-ImageNet) and compare HMN with eight DC baselines.

For\nrobotic agents, learning from the plethora of unlabeled video demonstration\ndata available on the Internet necessitates imitating the expert without access\nto its action, presenting a challenge known as Imitation Learning from\nObservations (ILfO). A common approach to tackle ILfO problems is to convert\nthem into inverse reinforcement learning problems, utilizing a proxy reward\ncomputed from the agent's and the expert's observations. Nonetheless, we\nidentify that tasks characterized by a progress dependency property pose\nsignificant challenges for such approaches; in these tasks, the agent needs to\ninitially learn the expert's preceding behaviors before mastering the\nsubsequent ones. Our investigation reveals that the main cause is that the\nreward signals assigned to later steps hinder the learning of initial\nbehaviors. To address this challenge, we present a novel ILfO framework that\nenables the agent to master earlier behaviors before advancing to later ones.\nWe introduce an Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism that adaptively\nalters the discount factor in reinforcement learning during the training phase,\nprioritizing earlier rewards initially and gradually engaging later rewards\nonly when the earlier behaviors have been mastered.

However, most existing GT-based methods usually explore the basic\ninteractions between pairwise atoms, and thus they fail to consider the\nimportant interactions among critical motifs (e.g., functional groups consisted\nof several atoms) of molecules. As motifs in a molecule are significant\npatterns that are of great importance for determining molecular properties\n(e.g., toxicity and solubility), overlooking motif interactions inevitably\nhinders the effectiveness of MPP. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nAtom-Motif Contrastive Transformer (AMCT), which not only explores the\natom-level interactions but also considers the motif-level interactions. Since\nthe representations of atoms and motifs for a given molecule are actually two\ndifferent views of the same instance, they are naturally aligned to generate\nthe self-supervisory signals for model training. Meanwhile, the same motif can\nexist in different molecules, and hence we also employ the contrastive loss to\nmaximize the representation agreement of identical motifs across different\nmolecules. Finally, in order to clearly identify the motifs that are critical\nin deciding the properties of each molecule, we further construct a\nproperty-aware attention mechanism into our learning framework.

Yet, using long contexts\nposes a challenge for responsive LLM systems, as nothing can be generated until\nall the contexts are fetched to and processed by the LLM. Existing systems\noptimize only the computation delay in context processing (e.g., by caching\nintermediate key-value features of the text context) but often cause longer\nnetwork delays in context fetching (e.g., key-value features consume orders of\nmagnitude larger bandwidth than the text context).\n  This paper presents CacheGen to minimize the delays in fetching and\nprocessing contexts for LLMs. CacheGen reduces the bandwidth needed for\ntransmitting long contexts' key-value (KV) features through a novel encoder\nthat compresses KV features into more compact bitstream representations. The\nencoder combines adaptive quantization with a tailored arithmetic coder, taking\nadvantage of the KV features' distributional properties, such as locality\nacross tokens. Furthermore, CacheGen minimizes the total delay in fetching and\nprocessing a context by using a controller that determines when to load the\ncontext as compressed KV features or raw text and picks the appropriate\ncompression level if loaded as KV features. We test CacheGen on three models of\nvarious sizes and three datasets of different context lengths. Compared to\nrecent methods that handle long contexts, CacheGen reduces bandwidth usage by\n3.7-4.3x and the total delay in fetching and processing contexts by 2.7-3x\nwhile maintaining similar LLM performance on various tasks as loading the text\ncontexts.\n","authors":["Yuhan Liu","Hanchen Li","Kuntai Du","Jiayi Yao","Yihua Cheng","Yuyang Huang","Shan Lu","Michael Maire","Henry Hoffmann","Ari Holtzman","Ganesh Ananthanarayanan","Junchen Jiang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07240v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07235v1","updated":"2023-10-11T06:53:05Z","published":"2023-10-11T06:53:05Z","title":"Are GATs Out of Balance?","summary":"  While the expressive power and computational capabilities of graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) have been theoretically studied, their optimization and\nlearning dynamics, in general, remain largely unexplored.

In\nparticular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a\nminimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an\ninternal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework\nwith provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we\ncall \"reason for future, act for now\" (\\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design\na prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a\nfuture trajectory over a long horizon (\"reason for future\"). At each step, the\nLLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (\"act for now\"),\nstores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning\nroutine to replan the future trajectory from the new state.\n  The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in\nBayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt\nLLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory\nbuffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps\nthat maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning\nsubroutines are performed in an \"in-context\" manner to emulate the actor-critic\nupdate for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of\nlong-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\\sqrt{T}$ regret.

Despite some empirical success of regularized policy iteration, its\ntheoretical underpinnings remain unclear. This paper proves that regularized\npolicy iteration is strictly equivalent to the standard Newton-Raphson method\nin the condition of smoothing out Bellman equation with strongly convex\nfunctions. This equivalence lays the foundation of a unified analysis for both\nglobal and local convergence behaviors of regularized policy iteration. We\nprove that regularized policy iteration has global linear convergence with the\nrate being $\\gamma$ (discount factor). Furthermore, this algorithm converges\nquadratically once it enters a local region around the optimal value. We also\nshow that a modified version of regularized policy iteration, i.e., with\nfinite-step policy evaluation, is equivalent to inexact Newton method where the\nNewton iteration formula is solved with truncated iterations. We prove that the\nassociated algorithm achieves an asymptotic linear convergence rate of\n$\\gamma^M$ in which $M$ denotes the number of steps carried out in policy\nevaluation. Our results take a solid step towards a better understanding of the\nconvergence properties of regularized policy iteration algorithms.\n","authors":["Zeyang Li","Chuxiong Hu","Yunan Wang","Guojian Zhan","Jie Li","Shengbo Eben Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07211v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07207v1","updated":"2023-10-11T05:34:46Z","published":"2023-10-11T05:34:46Z","title":"Robust Safe Reinforcement Learning under Adversarial Disturbances","summary":"  Safety is a primary concern when applying reinforcement learning to\nreal-world control tasks, especially in the presence of external disturbances.\nHowever, existing safe reinforcement learning algorithms rarely account for\nexternal disturbances, limiting their applicability and robustness in practice.\nTo address this challenge, this paper proposes a robust safe reinforcement\nlearning framework that tackles worst-case disturbances. First, this paper\npresents a policy iteration scheme to solve for the robust invariant set, i.e.,\na subset of the safe set, where persistent safety is only possible for states\nwithin. The key idea is to establish a two-player zero-sum game by leveraging\nthe safety value function in Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, in which\nthe protagonist (i.e., control inputs) aims to maintain safety and the\nadversary (i.e., external disturbances) tries to break down safety. This paper\nproves that the proposed policy iteration algorithm converges monotonically to\nthe maximal robust invariant set. Second, this paper integrates the proposed\npolicy iteration scheme into a constrained reinforcement learning algorithm\nthat simultaneously synthesizes the robust invariant set and uses it for\nconstrained policy optimization. This algorithm tackles both optimality and\nsafety, i.e., learning a policy that attains high rewards while maintaining\nsafety under worst-case disturbances. Experiments on classic control tasks show\nthat the proposed method achieves zero constraint violation with learned\nworst-case adversarial disturbances, while other baseline algorithms violate\nthe safety constraints substantially. Our proposed method also attains\ncomparable performance as the baselines even in the absence of the adversary.\n","authors":["Zeyang Li","Chuxiong Hu","Shengbo Eben Li","Jia Cheng","Yunan Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07207v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07204v1","updated":"2023-10-11T05:32:29Z","published":"2023-10-11T05:32:29Z","title":"State of the Art on Diffusion Models for Visual Computing","summary":"  The field of visual computing is rapidly advancing due to the emergence of\ngenerative artificial intelligence (AI), which unlocks unprecedented\ncapabilities for the generation, editing, and reconstruction of images, videos,\nand 3D scenes.

Previously\nproposed large language models for audio tasks either lack sufficient\nquantitative evaluations, or are limited to tasks for recognizing and\nunderstanding audio content, or significantly underperform existing\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. In this paper, we propose LauraGPT, a unified\nGPT model for audio recognition, understanding, and generation. LauraGPT is a\nversatile language model that can process both audio and text inputs and\ngenerate outputs in either modalities. It can perform a wide range of tasks\nrelated to content, semantics, paralinguistics, and audio-signal analysis. Some\nof its noteworthy tasks include automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text\ntranslation, text-to-speech synthesis, machine translation, speech enhancement,\nautomated audio captioning, speech emotion recognition, and spoken language\nunderstanding. To achieve this goal, we use a combination of continuous and\ndiscrete features for audio. We encode input audio into continuous\nrepresentations using an audio encoder and decode output audio from discrete\ncodec codes. We then fine-tune a large decoder-only Transformer-based language\nmodel on multiple audio-to-text, text-to-audio, audio-to-audio, and\ntext-to-text tasks using a supervised multitask learning approach.

This\npaper proposes a novel 11-dimensional feature set to detect MV-based video\nsteganography based on the above observation.

Recently, prompting Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent\nparadigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, this\nparadigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant\nerror correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing\nand applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which\nreframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling,\naction tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by using\nan LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the\naggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a\ntop-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time\nenvironmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing\nLLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding\ncalls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly\nconsumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to the\npreviously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the\naction tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading to\na 40.5% decrease in error corrections.

Currently, the design and implementation of such\nagents is ad hoc, as the wide variety of tasks that LLM-based agents may be\napplied to naturally means there can be no one-size-fits-all approach to agent\ndesign. In this work we aim to alleviate the difficulty of designing and\nimplementing new agents by proposing a minimalistic, high-level generation\nframework that simplifies the process of building agents. The framework we\nintroduce allows the user to specify desired agent behaviors in Linear Temporal\nLogic (LTL). The declarative LTL specification is then used to construct a\nconstrained decoder that guarantees the LLM will produce an output exhibiting\nthe desired behavior. By designing our framework in this way, we obtain several\nbenefits, including the ability to enforce complex agent behavior, the ability\nto formally validate prompt examples, and the ability to seamlessly incorporate\ncontent-focused logical constraints into generation. In particular, our\ndeclarative approach, in which the desired behavior is simply described without\nconcern for how it should be implemented or enforced, enables rapid design,\nimplementation and experimentation with different LLM-based agents.

However, these models have long inference latency, which limits\ntheir deployment and makes them prohibitively expensive for various real-time\napplications. The inference latency is further exacerbated by autoregressive\ngenerative tasks, as models need to run iteratively to generate tokens\nsequentially without leveraging token-level parallelization. To address this,\nwe propose Big Little Decoder (BiLD), a framework that can improve inference\nefficiency and latency for a wide range of text generation applications. The\nBiLD framework contains two models with different sizes that collaboratively\ngenerate text. The small model runs autoregressively to generate text with a\nlow inference cost, and the large model is only invoked occasionally to refine\nthe small model's inaccurate predictions in a non-autoregressive manner. To\ncoordinate the small and large models, BiLD introduces two simple yet effective\npolicies: (1) the fallback policy that determines when to hand control over to\nthe large model; and (2) the rollback policy that determines when the large\nmodel needs to correct the small model's inaccurate predictions. To evaluate\nour framework across different tasks and models, we apply BiLD to various text\ngeneration scenarios encompassing machine translation on IWSLT 2017 De-En and\nWMT 2014 De-En, and summarization on XSUM and CNN/DailyMail.

A challenging scenario for\nartificial intelligence (AI) is using biomedical data (e.g., texts, imaging,\nomics, and clinical) to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations for\ncancerous conditions. Data and knowledge about cancer, drugs, genes, proteins,\nand their mechanism is spread across structured (knowledge bases (KBs)) and\nunstructured (e.g., scientific articles) sources.

Such KGs not only allow\nexploration and question answering (QA) but also allow domain experts to deduce\nnew knowledge. However, exploring and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for\nnon-domain users due to a lack of understanding of the underlying data assets\nand semantic technologies. In this paper, we develop a domain KG to leverage\ncancer-specific biomarker discovery and interactive QA.

Bridging Emotion Role\n  Labeling and Appraisal-based Approaches","summary":"  The term emotion analysis in text subsumes various natural language\nprocessing tasks which have in common the goal to enable computers to\nunderstand emotions. Most popular is emotion classification in which one or\nmultiple emotions are assigned to a predefined textual unit. While such setting\nis appropriate for identifying the reader's or author's emotion, emotion role\nlabeling adds the perspective of mentioned entities and extracts text spans\nthat correspond to the emotion cause. The underlying emotion theories agree on\none important point; that an emotion is caused by some internal or external\nevent and comprises several subcomponents, including the subjective feeling and\na cognitive evaluation. We therefore argue that emotions and events are related\nin two ways. (1) Emotions are events; and this perspective is the fundament in\nnatural language processing for emotion role labeling. (2) Emotions are caused\nby events; a perspective that is made explicit with research how to incorporate\npsychological appraisal theories in NLP models to interpret events. These two\nresearch directions, role labeling and (event-focused) emotion classification,\nhave by and large been tackled separately.

Nevertheless, model parameters of\nmultilingual LMs remain large due to the larger embedding matrix of the\nvocabulary covering tokens in different languages. On the contrary, monolingual\nLMs can be trained in a target language with the language-specific vocabulary\nonly, but this requires a large budget and availability of reliable corpora to\nachieve a high-quality LM from scratch. In this paper, we propose\nvocabulary-trimming (VT), a method to reduce a multilingual LM vocabulary to a\ntarget language by deleting irrelevant tokens from its vocabulary. In theory,\nVT can compress any existing multilingual LM to build monolingual LMs in any\nlanguage covered by the multilingual LM. In our experiments, we show that VT\ncan retain the original performance of the multilingual LM, while being smaller\nin size (in general around 50% of the original vocabulary size is enough) than\nthe original multilingual LM. The evaluation is performed over four NLP tasks\n(two generative and two classification tasks) among four widely used\nmultilingual LMs in seven languages.

Unfortunately, they\nare prone to hallucinations, where the model exposes incorrect or false\ninformation in its responses, which renders diligent evaluation approaches\nmandatory. While LLM performance in specific knowledge fields is often\nevaluated based on question and answer (Q&A) datasets, such evaluations usually\nreport only a single accuracy number for the dataset, which often covers an\nentire field. This field-based evaluation, is problematic with respect to\ntransparency and model improvement. A stratified evaluation could instead\nreveal subfields, where hallucinations are more likely to occur and thus help\nto better assess LLMs' risks and guide their further development. To support\nsuch stratified evaluations, we propose LLMMaps as a novel visualization\ntechnique that enables users to evaluate LLMs' performance with respect to Q&A\ndatasets. LLMMaps provide detailed insights into LLMs' knowledge capabilities\nin different subfields, by transforming Q&A datasets as well as LLM responses\ninto an internal knowledge structure.

We\ninvestigate how a recent voice conversion model performs on non-standard\ndownstream voice conversion tasks.

LLM can be applied to various domains, but it contradicts the\nprinciples of information transmission when applied to the Islamic domain. In\nIslam we strictly regulates the sources of information and who can give\ninterpretations or tafseer for that sources [2]. The approach used by LLM to\ngenerate answers based on its own interpretation is similar to the concept of\ntafseer, LLM is neither an Islamic expert nor a human which is not permitted in\nIslam. Indonesia is the country with the largest Islamic believer population in\nthe world [3]. With the high influence of LLM, we need to make evaluation of\nLLM in religious domain. Currently, there is only few religious QA dataset\navailable and none of them using Sirah Nabawiyah especially in Indonesian\nLanguage. In this paper, we propose the Question Answering Sirah Nabawiyah\n(QASiNa) dataset, a novel dataset compiled from Sirah Nabawiyah literatures in\nIndonesian language. We demonstrate our dataset by using mBERT [4], XLM-R [5],\nand IndoBERT [6] which fine-tuned with Indonesian translation of SQuAD v2.0\n[7].

In particular, pretraining\nmethods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their\npotential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing\npretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT\npretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically\ntailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of\nexploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the\nfine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping\nand non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance\nimprovement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a\nvery low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less\ndistinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping\ntokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of\npre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that\nthese layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization\ncan benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate\npretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we\nintroduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the\ntask difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask\nboundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge. RandomMask is simple but\neffective, achieving top-tier performance across 26 datasets of 28 datasets\nspanning 7 downstream tasks.\n","authors":["Chaoqi Liang","Weiqiang Bai","Lifeng Qiao","Yuchen Ren","Jianle Sun","Peng Ye","Hongliang Yan","Xinzhu Ma","Wangmeng Zuo","Wanli Ouyang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07644v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06488v2","updated":"2023-10-12T03:23:40Z","published":"2023-10-10T09:57:17Z","title":"SpikeCLIP: A Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained Spiking Neural\n  Network","summary":"  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated the capability to achieve\ncomparable performance to deep neural networks (DNNs) in both visual and\nlinguistic domains while offering the advantages of improved energy efficiency\nand adherence to biological plausibility.

Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks, however, is a\nlong-standing challenge, and demands decomposing the overarching task into\nseveral manageable subtasks to facilitate policy learning and generalization to\nunseen tasks. Prior task decomposition methods require task-specific knowledge,\nare computationally intensive, and cannot readily be applied to new tasks. To\naddress these shortcomings, we propose Universal Visual Decomposer (UVD), an\noff-the-shelf task decomposition method for visual long horizon manipulation\nusing pre-trained visual representations designed for robotic control. At a\nhigh level, UVD discovers subgoals by detecting phase shifts in the embedding\nspace of the pre-trained representation. Operating purely on visual\ndemonstrations without auxiliary information, UVD can effectively extract\nvisual subgoals embedded in the videos, while incurring zero additional\ntraining cost on top of standard visuomotor policy training.

To tackle these challenges,\nour key insight is that human image is inherently structural over multiple\ngranularities, from the coarse-level body skeleton to fine-grained spatial\ngeometry. Therefore, capturing such correlations between the explicit\nappearance and latent structure in one model is essential to generate coherent\nand natural human images. To this end, we propose a unified framework,\nHyperHuman, that generates in-the-wild human images of high realism and diverse\nlayouts. Specifically, 1) we first build a large-scale human-centric dataset,\nnamed HumanVerse, which consists of 340M images with comprehensive annotations\nlike human pose, depth, and surface normal. 2) Next, we propose a Latent\nStructural Diffusion Model that simultaneously denoises the depth and surface\nnormal along with the synthesized RGB image. Our model enforces the joint\nlearning of image appearance, spatial relationship, and geometry in a unified\nnetwork, where each branch in the model complements to each other with both\nstructural awareness and textural richness. 3) Finally, to further boost the\nvisual quality, we propose a Structure-Guided Refiner to compose the predicted\nconditions for more detailed generation of higher resolution.

For\nexample, generating a video with a car moving in a prescribed manner under\nspecific camera movements to make a movie, or a video illustrating how a bear\nwould lift weights to inspire creators. Adaptation methods have been developed\nfor customizing appearance like subject or style, yet unexplored for motion. It\nis straightforward to extend mainstream adaption methods for motion\ncustomization, including full model tuning, parameter-efficient tuning of\nadditional layers, and Low-Rank Adaptions (LoRAs). However, the motion concept\nlearned by these methods is often coupled with the limited appearances in the\ntraining videos, making it difficult to generalize the customized motion to\nother appearances. To overcome this challenge, we propose MotionDirector, with\na dual-path LoRAs architecture to decouple the learning of appearance and\nmotion. Further, we design a novel appearance-debiased temporal loss to\nmitigate the influence of appearance on the temporal training objective.\nExperimental results show the proposed method can generate videos of diverse\nappearances for the customized motions. Our method also supports various\ndownstream applications, such as the mixing of different videos with their\nappearance and motion respectively, and animating a single image with\ncustomized motions.

However, it is challenging to explore the unnatural\ninteraction between point clouds and images, and the critical factor is how to\nconduct feature alignment of heterogeneous modalities. Currently, many methods\nachieve feature alignment by projection calibration only, without considering\nthe problem of coordinate conversion accuracy errors between sensors, leading\nto sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we present GraphAlign, a more\naccurate feature alignment strategy for 3D object detection by graph matching.\nSpecifically, we fuse image features from a semantic segmentation encoder in\nthe image branch and point cloud features from a 3D Sparse CNN in the LiDAR\nbranch. To save computation, we construct the nearest neighbor relationship by\ncalculating Euclidean distance within the subspaces that are divided into the\npoint cloud features. Through the projection calibration between the image and\npoint cloud, we project the nearest neighbors of point cloud features onto the\nimage features. Then by matching the nearest neighbors with a single point\ncloud to multiple images, we search for a more appropriate feature alignment.\nIn addition, we provide a self-attention module to enhance the weights of\nsignificant relations to fine-tune the feature alignment between heterogeneous\nmodalities.

The deviation in\nthe model is caused by both of these factors, and due to the fact that\nattributes are implicit in most datasets and the combination of attributes is\nvery complex, the intra-class imbalance is more difficult to handle. For this\npurpose, we proposed a long-tailed classification framework, known as\n\\textbf{\\textsc{Cognisance}}, which is founded on Coarse-Grained Leading Forest\n(CLF) and Multi-Center Loss (MCL), aiming to build a multi-granularity joint\nsolution model by means of invariant feature learning.

However, it has certain limitations. In this\npaper, we propose a new perspective on the effectiveness of spatial attention,\nwhich is that the spatial attention mechanism essentially solves the problem of\nconvolutional kernel parameter sharing. However, the information contained in\nthe attention map generated by spatial attention is not sufficient for\nlarge-size convolutional kernels. Therefore, we propose a novel attention\nmechanism called Receptive-Field Attention (RFA). Existing spatial attention,\nsuch as Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Coordinated Attention\n(CA) focus only on spatial features, which does not fully address the problem\nof convolutional kernel parameter sharing. In contrast, RFA not only focuses on\nthe receptive-field spatial feature but also provides effective attention\nweights for large-size convolutional kernels. The Receptive-Field Attention\nconvolutional operation (RFAConv), developed by RFA, represents a new approach\nto replace the standard convolution operation. It offers nearly negligible\nincrement of computational cost and parameters, while significantly improving\nnetwork performance. We conducted a series of experiments on ImageNet-1k, COCO,\nand VOC datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Nevertheless, the significant\ndomain gap between simulated and real-world data, including differences in\nsensor type, reflectance patterns, and road surroundings, often leads to poor\nperformance of models trained on simulated data when evaluated on real-world\ndata.

While few explorations have been performed in 3D\nscenarios. In this paper, we discuss three fundamental and interesting problems\non this topic. First, we equip text-guided diffusion models to achieve\n3D-consistent generation. Specifically, we integrate a NeRF-like neural field\nto generate low-resolution coarse results for a given camera view. Such results\ncan provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion\nprocess. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by\nmodeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream (corresponding to\ntwo different views) asynchronous diffusion process. Second, we study 3D local\nediting and propose a two-step solution that can generate 360-degree\nmanipulated results by editing an object from a single view. Step 1, we propose\nto perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted noises. Step 2, we\nconduct a noise-to-text inversion process that maps 2D blended noises into the\nview-independent text embedding space. Once the corresponding text embedding is\nobtained, 360-degree images can be generated. Last but not least, we extend our\nmodel to perform one-shot novel view synthesis by fine-tuning on a single\nimage, firstly showing the potential of leveraging text guidance for novel view\nsynthesis.

However, most studies for OOD detection\ndid not use pre-trained models and trained a backbone from scratch. In recent\nyears, transferring knowledge from large pre-trained models to downstream tasks\nby lightweight tuning has become mainstream for training in-distribution (ID)\nclassifiers. To bridge the gap between the practice of OOD detection and\ncurrent classifiers, the unique and crucial problem is that the samples whose\ninformation networks know often come as OOD input. We consider that such data\nmay significantly affect the performance of large pre-trained networks because\nthe discriminability of these OOD data depends on the pre-training algorithm.\nHere, we define such OOD data as PT-OOD (Pre-Trained OOD) data. In this paper,\nwe aim to reveal the effect of PT-OOD on the OOD detection performance of\npre-trained networks from the perspective of pre-training algorithms. To\nachieve this, we explore the PT-OOD detection performance of supervised and\nself-supervised pre-training algorithms with linear-probing tuning, the most\ncommon efficient tuning method.

Yet, the zero-shot performance is less competitive\nthan a fully supervised one. Thus, to enhance the performance, fine-tuning and\nensembling are also commonly adopted to better fit the downstream tasks.\nHowever, we argue that such prior work has overlooked the inherent biases in\nfoundation models. Due to the highly imbalanced Web-scale training set, these\nfoundation models are inevitably skewed toward frequent semantics, and thus the\nsubsequent fine-tuning or ensembling is still biased. In this study, we\nsystematically examine the biases in foundation models and demonstrate the\nefficacy of our proposed Generalized Logit Adjustment (GLA) method. Note that\nbias estimation in foundation models is challenging, as most pre-train data\ncannot be explicitly accessed like in traditional long-tailed classification\ntasks. To this end, GLA has an optimization-based bias estimation approach for\ndebiasing foundation models.

To overcome this limitation, point cloud completion methods have\nbeen developed to predict the complete shape of an object based on its partial\ninput. These methods can be broadly classified as supervised or unsupervised.\nHowever, both categories require a large number of 3D complete point clouds,\nwhich may be difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose Cross-PCC, an\nunsupervised point cloud completion method without requiring any 3D complete\npoint clouds. We only utilize 2D images of the complete objects, which are\neasier to capture than 3D complete and clean point clouds. Specifically, to\ntake advantage of the complementary information from 2D images, we use a\nsingle-view RGB image to extract 2D features and design a fusion module to fuse\nthe 2D and 3D features extracted from the partial point cloud. To guide the\nshape of predicted point clouds, we project the predicted points of the object\nto the 2D plane and use the foreground pixels of its silhouette maps to\nconstrain the position of the projected points. To reduce the outliers of the\npredicted point clouds, we propose a view calibrator to move the points\nprojected to the background into the foreground by the single-view silhouette\nimage.

Current approaches all follow the Siamese paradigm\nbased on appearance matching. However, LiDAR point clouds are usually\ntextureless and incomplete, which hinders effective appearance matching.\nBesides, previous methods greatly overlook the critical motion clues among\ntargets. In this work, beyond 3D Siamese tracking, we introduce a\nmotion-centric paradigm to handle LiDAR SOT from a new perspective. Following\nthis paradigm, we propose a matching-free two-stage tracker M^2-Track. At the\n1st-stage, M^2-Track localizes the target within successive frames via motion\ntransformation. Then it refines the target box through motion-assisted shape\ncompletion at the 2nd-stage. Due to the motion-centric nature, our method shows\nits impressive generalizability with limited training labels and provides good\ndifferentiability for end-to-end cycle training. This inspires us to explore\nsemi-supervised LiDAR SOT by incorporating a pseudo-label-based motion\naugmentation and a self-supervised loss term. Under the fully-supervised\nsetting, extensive experiments confirm that M^2-Track significantly outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-arts on three large-scale datasets while running at 57FPS\n(~3%, ~11% and ~22% precision gains on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset\nrespectively).

They achieve this by\nrecording changes in light intensity (known as events), thus allowing them to\noperate at a much higher frequency and making them suitable for capturing\nmotions in a highly dynamic scene. Many recent studies have proposed methods to\ntrain neural networks (NNs) for predicting optical flow from events. However,\nthey often rely on a spatio-temporal representation constructed from events\nover a fixed interval, such as 10Hz used in training on the DSEC dataset. This\nlimitation restricts the flow prediction to the same interval (10Hz) whereas\nthe fast speed of event cameras, which can operate up to 3kHz, has not been\neffectively utilized. In this work, we show that a temporally dense flow\nestimation at 100Hz can be achieved by treating the flow estimation as a\nsequential problem using two different variants of recurrent networks -\nLong-short term memory (LSTM) and spiking neural network (SNN). First, We\nutilize the NN model constructed similar to the popular EV-FlowNet but with\nLSTM layers to demonstrate the efficiency of our training method. The model not\nonly produces 10x more frequent optical flow than the existing ones, but the\nestimated flows also have 13% lower errors than predictions from the baseline\nEV-FlowNet. Second, we construct an EV-FlowNet SNN but with leaky integrate and\nfire neurons to efficiently capture the temporal dynamics. We found that simple\ninherent recurrent dynamics of SNN lead to significant parameter reduction\ncompared to the LSTM model. In addition, because of its event-driven\ncomputation, the spiking model is estimated to consume only 1.5% energy of the\nLSTM model, highlighting the efficiency of SNN in processing events and the\npotential for achieving temporally dense flow.\n","authors":["Wachirawit Ponghiran","Chamika Mihiranga Liyanagedera","Kaushik Roy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01244v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07969v1","updated":"2023-10-12T01:25:21Z","published":"2023-10-12T01:25:21Z","title":"CleftGAN: Adapting A Style-Based Generative Adversarial Network To\n  Create Images Depicting Cleft Lip Deformity","summary":"  A major obstacle when attempting to train a machine learning system to\nevaluate facial clefts is the scarcity of large datasets of high-quality,\nethics board-approved patient images.

Recently, prompting Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent\nparadigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, this\nparadigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant\nerror correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing\nand applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which\nreframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling,\naction tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by using\nan LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the\naggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a\ntop-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time\nenvironmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing\nLLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding\ncalls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly\nconsumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to the\npreviously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the\naction tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading to\na 40.5% decrease in error corrections.

An extensive\nzero-shot evaluation of 39 VLMs, ranging from 100M to 80B parameters, shows a\nnuanced performance landscape. While VLMs are reasonably good at identifying\ncertain stylistic \\textit{data-types}, such as cartoons and sketches, they\nstruggle with simpler \\textit{data-types} arising from basic manipulations like\nimage rotations or additive noise. Our findings reveal that (i) model scaling\nalone yields marginal gains for contrastively-trained models like CLIP, and\n(ii) there is a pronounced drop in performance for the largest\nauto-regressively trained VLMs like OpenFlamingo. This finding points to a\nblind spot in current frontier VLMs: they excel in recognizing semantic content\nbut fail to acquire an understanding of visual \\textit{data-types} through\nscaling. By analyzing the pre-training distributions of these models and\nincorporating \\textit{data-type} information into the captions during\nfine-tuning, we achieve a significant enhancement in performance. By exploring\nthis previously uncharted task, we aim to set the stage for further advancing\nVLMs to equip them with visual data-type understanding.

However,\nexploration bonuses can bias the learned policy, and our experiments find that\nnaive, yet standard use of such bonuses can fail to recover a performant\npolicy. Concurrently, pessimistic training in offline RL has enabled recovery\nof performant policies from static datasets. Can we leverage offline RL to\nrecover better policies from online interaction? We make a simple observation\nthat a policy can be trained from scratch on all interaction data with\npessimistic objectives, thereby decoupling the policies used for data\ncollection and for evaluation. Specifically, we propose offline retraining, a\npolicy extraction step at the end of online fine-tuning in our\nOffline-to-Online-to-Offline (OOO) framework for reinforcement learning (RL).\nAn optimistic (exploration) policy is used to interact with the environment,\nand a separate pessimistic (exploitation) policy is trained on all the observed\ndata for evaluation. Such decoupling can reduce any bias from online\ninteraction (intrinsic rewards, primacy bias) in the evaluation policy, and can\nallow more exploratory behaviors during online interaction which in turn can\ngenerate better data for exploitation.

The development of algorithmic techniques for quantifying\nrelationships between source and impact variables related to a climate event\n(i.e., a climate pathway) would help inform policy decisions. Data-driven deep\nlearning models have become powerful tools for modeling highly nonlinear\nrelationships and may provide a route to characterize climate variable\nrelationships. In this paper, we explore the use of an echo state network (ESN)\nfor characterizing climate pathways. ESNs are a computationally efficient\nneural network variation designed for temporal data, and recent work proposes\nESNs as a useful tool for forecasting spatio-temporal climate data. Like other\nneural networks, ESNs are non-interpretable black-box models, which poses a\nhurdle for understanding variable relationships. We address this issue by\ndeveloping feature importance methods for ESNs in the context of\nspatio-temporal data to quantify variable relationships captured by the model.\nWe conduct a simulation study to assess and compare the feature importance\ntechniques, and we demonstrate the approach on reanalysis climate data. In the\nclimate application, we select a time period that includes the 1991 volcanic\neruption of Mount Pinatubo. This event was a significant stratospheric aerosol\ninjection, which we use as a proxy for an artificial stratospheric aerosol\ninjection. Using the proposed approach, we are able to characterize\nrelationships between pathway variables associated with this event.\n","authors":["Katherine Goode","Daniel Ries","Kellie McClernon"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08495v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08491v1","updated":"2023-10-12T16:50:08Z","published":"2023-10-12T16:50:08Z","title":"Prometheus: Inducing Fine-grained Evaluation Capability in Language\n  Models","summary":"  Recently, using a powerful proprietary Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g.,\nGPT-4) as an evaluator for long-form responses has become the de facto\nstandard.

These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the\nsetting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss\nminimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the\ncriteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we\npresent a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted\nChebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect\nto several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can\nidentify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its\ncomplexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems\nare then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of\npopular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,\nwhile efficaciously handling constraints.

The CAMs are then used\nto generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise a\nsegmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. Our work is\nbased on two techniques for improving CAMs; importance sampling, which is a\nsubstitute for GAP, and the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristic\nthat object contours almost always align with color edges in images. However,\nboth are based on the multinomial posterior with softmax, and implicitly assume\nthat classes are mutually exclusive, which turns out suboptimal in our\nexperiments.

Concurrently, another relevant issue\nregards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all\napplications. Such as when only 2D images are considered as input in a RL\napproach used for finding the optimal action within a 3D simulation\nenvironment. In this work, we address these issues by deploying and testing\nseveral techniques to balance exploration and exploitation trade-off on\npartially observable systems for predicting steering wheels in autonomous\ndriving scenario. More precisely, the final aim is to investigate the effects\nof using both stochastic and deterministic multi-armed bandit strategies\ncoupled with a Deep Recurrent Q-Network. Additionally, we adapted and evaluated\nthe impact of an innovative method to improve the learning phase of the\nunderlying Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network.

To fill these gaps, we propose\nthe notion of gradient sparsity as one source of activation sparsity and a\ntheoretical explanation based on it that sees sparsity a necessary step to\nadversarial robustness w.r.t. hidden features and parameters, which is\napproximately the flatness of minima for well-learned models.

Our theoretical results are established for a\ngeneral loss belonging to a rich loss function family, which includes many\ncommonly used methods as special cases, such as mean regression, quantile\nregression, likelihood-based classification, and margin-based classification.\nTwo types of covariate shift problems are the focus of this paper and the sharp\nconvergence rates are established for a general loss function to provide a\nunified theoretical analysis, which concurs with the optimal results in\nliterature where the squared loss is used. Extensive numerical studies on\nsynthetic and real examples confirm our theoretical findings and further\nillustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n","authors":["Xingdong Feng","Xin He","Caixing Wang","Chao Wang","Jingnan Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08237v1.pdf","comment":"Poster to appear in Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information\n  Processing Systems"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08235v1","updated":"2023-10-12T11:31:01Z","published":"2023-10-12T11:31:01Z","title":"GROOT: Learning to Follow Instructions by Watching Gameplay Videos","summary":"  We study the problem of building a controller that can follow open-ended\ninstructions in open-world environments.

Ritz and Galerkin approach with finite element discretization are\ndeveloped for VOL to achieve matrix-free approximation of system functional and\nresidual, then direct minimization and iterative update are proposed as two\noptimization strategies for VOL. Various types of experiments based on\nreasonable benchmarks about variable heat source, Darcy flow, and variable\nstiffness elasticity are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of VOL.\nWith a label-free training set and a 5-label-only shift set, VOL learns\nsolution operators with its test errors decreasing in a power law with respect\nto the amount of unlabeled data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is\nthe first study that integrates the perspectives of the weak form and efficient\niterative methods for solving sparse linear systems into the end-to-end\noperator learning task.\n","authors":["Tengfei Xu","Dachuan Liu","Peng Hao","Bo Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04234v2.pdf","comment":"35 pages, 6 figures with 5 extended figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14133v2","updated":"2023-10-12T09:18:09Z","published":"2023-05-23T14:56:19Z","title":"Conditional Mutual Information for Disentangled Representations in\n  Reinforcement Learning","summary":"  Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments can produce training data with\nspurious correlations between features due to the amount of training data or\nits limited feature coverage.

Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO)\nspecialize to group shifts and require group information on all training\npoints. Other methods (e.g., CVaR DRO) that do not need group annotations can\nbe overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may\nform a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the\nreal world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training\npoints). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a\nmore nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the\ntrue group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may\nexpect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g., image\nbackground, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high\naccuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that\nneed not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived\ngroups of examples. Based on this, we consider the two-player game formulation\nof DRO where the adversary's capacity is bitrate-constrained.

To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of\nexploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the\nfine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping\nand non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance\nimprovement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a\nvery low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less\ndistinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping\ntokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of\npre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that\nthese layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization\ncan benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate\npretraining with fast convergence.

Compared to traditional\ntext-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for\nvoice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly\nsince speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS\napproaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the\none-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be\ndescribed in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt\ndatasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write\ntext prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address\nthese challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of\nvoice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize\nthe large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts.\nSpecifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from\nthe reference speech (which contains full information about voice variability)\nbased on the text prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it\ngenerates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to\nrecognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large\nlanguage model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results.\nExperiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that\ncompared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices more consistent\nwith text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability,\nthereby offering users more choices on voice generation. Additionally, the\nprompt generation pipeline produces high-quality text prompts, eliminating the\nlarge labeling cost.

Users can fully immersive themselves in volumetric video with\nthe ability to switch their viewport in six degree-of-freedom (DOF), including\nthree rotational dimensions (yaw, pitch, roll) and three translational\ndimensions (X, Y, Z). Different from traditional 2D videos that are composed of\npixel matrices, volumetric videos employ point clouds, meshes, or voxels to\nrepresent a volumetric scene, resulting in significantly larger data sizes.\nWhile previous works have successfully achieved volumetric video streaming in\nvideo-on-demand scenarios, the live streaming of volumetric video remains an\nunresolved challenge due to the limited network bandwidth and stringent latency\nconstraints. In this paper, we for the first time propose a holistic live\nvolumetric video streaming system, LiveVV, which achieves multi-view capture,\nscene segmentation \\& reuse, adaptive transmission, and rendering. LiveVV\ncontains multiple lightweight volumetric video capture modules that are capable\nof being deployed without prior preparation. To reduce bandwidth consumption,\nLiveVV processes static and dynamic volumetric content separately by reusing\nstatic data with low disparity and decimating data with low visual saliency.\nBesides, to deal with network fluctuation, LiveVV integrates a volumetric video\nadaptive bitrate streaming algorithm (VABR) to enable fluent playback with the\nmaximum quality of experience. Extensive real-world experiment shows that\nLiveVV can achieve live volumetric video streaming at a frame rate of 24 fps\nwith a latency of less than 350ms.\n","authors":["Kaiyuan Hu","Yongting Chen","Kaiying Han","Junhua Liu","Haowen Yang","Yili Jin","Boyan Li","Fangxin Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08205v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08006v1","updated":"2023-10-12T03:19:13Z","published":"2023-10-12T03:19:13Z","title":"MCPNS: A Macropixel Collocated Position and Its Neighbors Search for\n  Plenoptic 2.0 Video Coding","summary":"  Recently, it was demonstrated that a newly focused plenoptic 2.0 camera can\ncapture much higher spatial resolution owing to its effective light field\nsampling, as compared to a traditional unfocused plenoptic 1.0 camera. However,\ndue to the nature difference of the optical structure between the plenoptic 1.0\nand 2.0 cameras, the existing fast motion estimation (ME) method for plenoptic\n1.0 videos is expected to be sub-optimal for encoding plenoptic 2.0 videos. In\nthis paper, we point out the main motion characteristic differences between\nplenoptic 1.0 and 2.0 videos and then propose a new fast ME, called macropixel\ncollocated position and its neighbors search (MCPNS) for plenoptic 2.0 videos.\nIn detail, we propose to reduce the number of macropixel collocated position\n(MCP) search candidates based on the new observation of center-biased motion\nvector distribution at macropixel resolution. After that, due to large motion\ndeviation behavior around each MCP location in plenoptic 2.0 videos, we propose\nto select a certain number of key MCP locations with the lowest matching cost\nto perform the neighbors MCP search to improve the motion search accuracy.\nDifferent from existing methods, our method can achieve better performance\nwithout requiring prior knowledge of microlens array orientations.
